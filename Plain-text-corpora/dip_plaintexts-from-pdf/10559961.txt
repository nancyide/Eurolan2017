Formation of AP-3 transport intermediates requires Vps41 function

Peter Rehling*, Tamara Darsow*, David J. Katzmann* and Scott D. Emr* *Division of Cellular and Molecular Medicine and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093-0668, USA e-mail: semr@ucsd.edu  These authors contributed equally to this work Transport of a subset of membrane proteins to the yeast vacuole requires the function of the AP-3 adaptor protein complex. To define the molecular requirements of vesicular transport in this pathway, we used a biochemical approach to analyse the formation and content of the AP-3 transport intermediate. A vam3tsf (vacuolar t-SNARE) mutant blocks vesicle docking and fusion with the vacuole and causes the accumulation of 50­130-nanometre membrane vesicles, which we isolated and showed by biochemical analysis and immunocytochemistry to contain both AP-3 adaptors and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) pathway cargoes. Inactivation of AP-3 or the protein Vps41 blocks formation of this vesicular intermediate. Vps41 binds to the AP-3 -adaptin subunit, suggesting that they function together in the formation of ALP pathway transport intermediates at the late Golgi.

he process of vesicular transport of proteins through the secretory pathway can be subdivided into at least three different steps. The first is the selective concentration of cargo mol-

ecules into budding vesicles; this is followed by the budding reaction which requires fission of a vesicle from the donor membrane; the third step is the docking and fusion of the vesicle with the appropriate acceptor membrane. These processes depend on cytosolic adaptor and coat proteins that direct both cargo selection and deformation of membranes into nascent vesicles1,2, and conserved membrane docking and fusion proteins (such as SNARE molecules, Rabs and ATPases) that are responsible for targeting and fusion with the target organelle3,4. Protein trafficking to the vacuole of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been a powerful system for studying vesiclemediated protein transport. Examination of the genes involved in Golgi-to-vacuole transport (VPS genes) uncovered at least two independent biosynthetic pathways that sort distinct sets of cargo molecules to the vacuole5­7. The CPY pathway defines the major transport route by which many resident vacuolar proteins, such as the soluble hydrolase carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) and the vacuolar membrane protein carboxypeptidase S (CPS), are delivered to the vacuole through an endosomal intermediate8. In contrast, the vacuolar membrane protein alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and the vacuolar t-SNARE Vam3 travel through a second pathway to the vacuole--the ALP pathway--in a manner that bypasses the CPY pathway endosome7,9,10. Transport through the ALP pathway requires the function of the four subunits of the heterotetrameric adaptor protein complex AP-3 (refs 9,11) and both ALP and Vam3 contain acidic di-leucine sorting signals (EQXXLL, single-letter amino-acid notation) in their cytoplasmic domains that are required for AP-3-dependent transport to the vacuole5,12,13. Genetic evidence suggests that the protein Vps41 also functions in the ALP pathway, as conditional mutants in VPS41 display ALP-specific sorting defects5. The function of Vps41 in the ALP pathway is currently unknown. Transport pathways regulated by the AP-3 adaptor complex have important biological roles in humans, flies and mice. Mutations in the 3A- and -adaptin subunits of AP-3 result in coat colour defects as well as bleeding disorders in mice14,15. Moreover, adaptin subunit mutations in Drosophila result in eye pigmentation defects16. Defects in the AP-3 3A subunit in humans lead to a medically relevant inherited disorder, Hermansky­Pudlack Syndrome (HPS), which is characterized by oculocutaneous albinism and a complete lack of dense granules in platelets, resulting in prolonged bleeding times17. Additionally, in cells isolated from HPS patients

defective in 3A, a subset of resident lysosomal membrane proteins is mislocalized to the cell surface. Together, these data implicate AP-3 in sorting not only to lysosomes, but also to specialized organelles such as melanosomes and platelet storage granules. Therefore, although much is known in both yeast and higher eukaryotes about the genetic requirements for transport in AP-3dependent pathways, the composition of the transport intermediates and the molecules involved in their formation are not clearly defined. To address these questions, we undertook a biochemical characterization of transport through the AP-3-dependent pathway. We identified and characterized the ALP pathway vesicular intermediate and found that Vps41, together with AP-3, is required for the formation of this intermediate.

Results Arresting AP-3 cargoes in a prevacuolar compartment. Transport through the ALP pathway is rapid and therefore intermediates are not abundant under steady-state conditions in vivo. To induce accumulation of prevacuolar membrane intermediates in the ALP pathway, we used a vam3tsf mutant that blocks docking and fusion of transport intermediates with the vacuole16. Fractionation experiments were carried out in both wild-type cells and vam3tsf cells. As expected, in wild-type cells, Vam3 and mature ALP (mALP) were predominantly found in a 13,000g pellet (P13), reflecting their vacuolar localization, whereas the soluble form of ALP (sALP) was recovered in the 100,000g soluble fraction (S100) (Fig. 1a)5. In vam3tsf mutant cells at the non-permissive temperature, in addition to mature and soluble ALP in the P13 and S100 fractions, a significant amount of precursor ALP (pALP) was recovered in the 100,000g pellet fraction (P100). Furthermore, more than 40% of Vam3 was localized to the non-vacuolar P100 fraction (Fig. 1a). Therefore, a late block in transport through the ALP pathway results in the accumulation of biosynthetic cargoes in a non-vacuolar membrane fraction. To further characterize the compartment(s) containing the ALP pathway cargoes, we used an equilibrium density gradient. Vacuolar membranes, as indicated by the presence of mALP and a portion of Vam3, were detected in fractions 2­3 of the gradient18,19 whereas soluble proteins such as sALP were predominantly detected in fractions 3­5 (Fig. 1b, c). However, the majority of ALP in the gradient was in the precursor form, and migrated as a single peak in fractions 5­8, clearly separated from vacuolar membranes and soluble proteins (Fig. 1b, c). In addition, the non-vacuolar portion of Vam3 and the membrane-associated AP-3 subunits Apl6 and Apl5, co-

Figure 1 Enrichment and co-localization of ALP pathway cargoes and AP-3. a, ALP pathway cargo localization in wild-type and vam3tsf cells. Wild-type (PRY1; WT) and vam3tsf (PRY3 + pVAM3-6.414) cells, expressing Apl5­HA from the chromosome, were spheroplasted, lysed and fractionated (see Methods). 1 OD600 equivalent was loaded in each lane and protein­antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) fluorography. b, Accudenz equilibrium gradient of cell-free lysates of vam3tsf cells (PRY3 + pVAM3-6.414) expressing Apl5­HA were prepared after 1h incubation at 38°C (see Methods). Equal volumes of the gradient fractions (corresponding to 1 OD600) were separated on an 8% SDS­PAGE gel and immunoblotted. Antibody­protein complexes were visualized by ECL fluorography. For quantitative analysis, ALP western blots were analysed by densitometry with NIH Image (Scion Image 1.62a). c, The percentages of mALP, sALP and pALP respectively of the total amount of ALP were plotted over the gradient. d, Comparison of the localization patterns of pALP, pCPS and Kex2 in the gradient.

migrated together with pALP in these fractions (Fig. 1b). Kex2 (a trans-Golgi membrane marker20,21) and CPS (a type II transmembrane protein that traffics through the CPY pathway6) consistently displayed more restricted distributions within the gradient than pALP and migrated to a higher density with their peaks in fraction 7 (Fig. 1d). Therefore, in vam3tsf mutant cells, we were able to accumulate and enrich the AP-3 pathway cargo proteins together with the AP-3 complex components in a membrane compartment that was distinct from the vacuole, Golgi and endosome. AP-3, Vam3 and pALP are located in a common membrane. To examine the membrane compartments from gradient fractions, we first performed protease protection assays and demonstrated that the membranes in the gradient were sealed and that membrane proteins maintained their appropriate topology (data not shown). We then immunopurified membranes from the gradient fractions using Dynabeads coated with anti-haemagglutinin (HA) antibody for the isolation of HA-tagged Apl5. More than 90% of Apl5­HA and Apl6 were reproducibly isolated in these immunoprecipitations (Fig. 2a). Together with the AP-3 complex, we routinely co-purified

about 50% of pALP and 40% of Vam3 from the fraction. A final wash of the isolated material in the presence or absence of 0.5% Triton-X100 differentiated between proteins that were components of the same membrane vesicle and those that were physically associated with the immunoprecipitated protein. Incubation with detergent released significant amounts of Vam3 and pALP from the beads into the soluble fraction, whereas the AP-3 complex component Apl6 remained bound. Therefore, while AP-3 components Apl5 and Apl6 associate independently of a membrane, Vam3 and pALP immunopurify in part because of their residence on the same membrane. Experiments using anti-Vam3 antibodies to immunoprecipitate membrane compartments yielded similar results, with significant co-isolation of AP-3 proteins and detergent-soluble pALP (Fig. 2b). The Triton-X100-resistant nature of the Vam3 and AP-3 co-isolation in these experiments suggests a protein­protein interaction, possibly reflecting binding of AP-3 to the di-leucine targeting signal within Vam3 or ALP, as previously suggested by genetic analysis9,12,13. We did not detect significant amounts of the CPY pathway cargo CPS (<5% of the total) or the trans-Golgi marker Kex2 (<1% of the total) in the bound fractions (data not shown) although significant amounts of both proteins were present in the starting material. Therefore, we can exclude the possibility that Golgi, endosomes or endosomal intermediates were significantly enriched in this immunoisolation procedure. Furthermore, clathrin was not identified in the immunoprecipitations (data not shown), consistent with previous data indicating that ALP transport is not blocked in clathrin mutants13. Vam3 and AP-3 co-localize to vesicles. To corroborate the biochemical findings and to examine the ultrastructural morphology of the isolated intermediates, we performed immunoisolation experiments as described above and subjected the Dynabeads to routine morphological analysis and immunocytochemistry. Both anti-Vam3 Dynabeads (Fig. 3a) and anti-HA Dynabeads (recognizing Apl5­HA; Fig. 3b, c) isolated a large number of membrane vesicles. Statistical analysis of thin sections showed that more than 80% of the membranes ranged in size from 50 to 130 nm. None of the isolated membranes displayed obvious coats despite staining to enhance coat visibility. Control samples using Dynabeads coated with unrelated antibodies (mouse IgG or rabbit IgG) were free of membrane structures (data not shown). We incubated membranes isolated with antibodies against Apl5­HA with anti-Vam3 antibodies followed by 5-nm gold conjugates with goat anti-rabbit IgG and then processed samples for electron microscopy. We observed significant labelling of membranes

Figure 3 Morphology and immunocytochemistry of immunoisolated vesicles from vam3tsf cells. Immunoisolation from Accudenz gradient fractions (5­7) from vam3tsf cells (PRY3 + pVAM3-6.414) expressing Apl5­HA, using either anti-Vam3 antibodies (a) or anti-HA antibodies (b, c). After washing the beads, samples were processed for routine morphological analysis (a, b) or immunocytochemistry (c) in which anti-HA-coated beads were incubated with anti-Vam3 antibodies following immunoisolation. Black arrowheads in a indicate dense 50­130-nm vesicles; white arrowheads point to larger membrane structures. In c, anti-Vam3 antibodies were detected with 5-nm gold­goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugates (black arrowheads). Scale bars represent 250nm (a), 100nm (b), and 50nm (c).

with 5-nm gold particles, indicating that Vam3 and Apl5 reside on the same membrane compartment. Gold labelling was absent on membranes when rabbit IgG was used in place of anti-Vam3 antibodies. Around 90% of the vesicles that labelled with more than three gold particles were between 50 and 130 nm in size (Fig. 3c). Thus, the morphological analysis demonstrated that the smaller class of vesicular structures (50­130 nm) that had been preferentially isolated from the cells contained both the associated AP-3 proteins and ALP pathway cargo Vam3 but were devoid of CPY pathway cargo as shown biochemically (see above). Separation of AP-3 vesicles from trans-Golgi. Because the putative AP-3 transport vesicles isolated on Accudenz gradients still showed partial overlap with the trans-Golgi marker Kex2, we used an additional and independent purification scheme to resolve the AP-3 transport intermediates. We used two successive sucrose gradients, the first to separate membranes quickly from soluble proteins and the second to separate membranes on the basis of differential densities (Fig. 4a). A 13,000g fraction (S13) from vam3tsf cells was loaded onto a two-step sucrose gradient and, after centrifugation, the membrane fraction from the gradient was collected, diluted to 10% sucrose and loaded on top of a second, eight-step sucrose gradient (see Methods). Following centrifugation to equilibrium, 14 fractions were collected from the gradient and analysed for protein distribution. pALP and Vam3 were detected in two major peaks: a light membrane peak in fractions 8­10 at 30­32% wt/wt sucrose, which we refer to as the combined L-fraction; and a high-density peak in fractions 12­14 at 35­46% sucrose, which we refer to as the combined H-fraction (Fig. 4a). The AP-3 complex proteins Apl5­HA and Apl6 showed peaks in both the L- and H-membrane fractions. In addition, AP-3 proteins were detected in a third fraction that partially coincides with soluble markers such as sALP (Fig. 4a), although it has a much wider distribution. However, as vesicle membrane markers such as pALP and Vam3 were not detected in these fractions, and the association of AP-3 with the membrane over the duration of these experiments is unstable (data not shown), it is likely that this pool represents a soluble pool of the AP3 complex proteins (S-fraction). The Golgi-membrane marker Kex2 was recovered exclusively in the heavy fractions of the gradient. Thus, the L-fraction in the gradient represents a non-Golgi pool of membrane containing the AP-3 components and cargoes. A quantitative analysis of the purification procedure (Fig. 4b) showed that we were able to reproducibly enrich pALP in the L-fraction 45fold over the initial concentration in cell lysates. Therefore, the use of two successive sucrose gradients allowed us to separate a lowdensity, most probably vesicular, pool of AP-3 membranes away from fractions containing Kex2. VPS41 and VAM3 mutants differentially affect ALP transport. Much like AP-3 protein complex mutants9,11, vps41tsf mutants are specifically deficient for transport through the ALP pathway6. To further characterize the effect of vps41tsf mutants on transport through the AP-3dependent pathway we examined the localization of Vam3, ALP and AP-3 proteins in these mutants. Fractionation experiments on vps41tsf cells at the non-permissive temperature revealed that, as invam3tsf cells, pALPandVam3accumulateinaP100fraction(Fig.5a).However,further sucrose-gradient analyses of vps41tsf revealed that pALP and Vam3 were highly enriched in the H-fraction together with Kex2 (Fig. 5b), in contrast to vam3tsf cells (Fig. 4) where they are distributed in both the L- and H-fractions. Furthermore, comparison of the distribution of Apl6 in vps41tsf and vam3tsf gradient fractions showed that most of the AP-3 complex was in the H-fraction in the vps41tsf gradient (Fig. 5b, c), whereas in vam3tsf gradients most of the AP-3 complex was in the Lfraction, corresponding to the vesicle-associated pool (Fig. 4a, Fig. 5c). Therefore, the ALP transport defects in vps41tsf are distinct from those in vam3tsf cells and cannot be due to impaired binding of AP-3 to Golgi structures. Vesicle formation is inhibited by mutations in AP-3 and VPS41. To ascertain the roles of Vps41 and AP-3 in the ALP pathway, vam3tsf apm3 and vam3tsf vps41tsf double mutants were assayed by the sucrose-gradient enrichment protocol for their ability to form vesicular intermediates. Unlike vam3tsf cells at non-permissive temperatures, vam3tsf apm3 cells did not show a second peak of pALP and Vam3 in the L-fraction. In the double mutant both AP-3 vesicle marker proteins were predominantly found together with Kex2 in the H-fraction, as exemplified by pALP distribution in Fig. 6, further indicating that the pool of AP-3, pALP and Vam3 found in the L-fraction of gradients from vam3tsf extracts represents AP-3-associated vesicles. When we analysed the gradient fractions derived

Figure 5 Biochemical analysis of VPS41 and AP-3 mutant cells. a, vps41tsf (PRY9 + pVPS41-85) cells expressing Apl5­HA from the chromosome were spheroplasted, lysed and fractionated (see Methods). 1 OD600 equivalent was loaded in each lane and protein­antibody complexes were visualized by ECL fluorography. OD600 equivalents of vps41tsf (PRY9 + pVPS41-85) cells were lysed and processed for the two successive sucrose gradient centrifugation steps as described in Methods. b, Antibody­protein complexes were visualized by ECL fluorography. c, Quantification of western blots comparing the Apl6 distribution in the S-, L- and Hfractions of vam3tsf (PRY3 + pVAM3-6.414) and vps41tsf (PRY9 + pVPS41-85) cells was done by densitometry using NIH Image (Scion Image 1.62a).

from vam3tsf vps41tsf cells, we found an identical distribution of pALP and Vam3 to that observed in vam3tsf apm3, vps41tfs and apl5 (Fig. 6) gradients, consistent with a role for Vps41 with AP-3 in the formation of ALP vesicles. Vps41 binds to AP-3 through the carboxy terminus of Apl5. Our observation that the formation of AP-3-coated vesicles, but not the membrane association of AP-3, seemed to be affected in vps41tsf cells suggested an early function for Vps41 in the ALP pathway. To assay for interactions between Vps41 and components of the ALP pathway, we used a directed two-hybrid assay and tested whether Vps41 could bind to AP-3. We found that coexpression of a Vps41­prey construct (Gal4­AD­Vps41) together with Apl5­bait construct (Gal4­DB­Apl5) in the yeast reporter strain led to reporter gene activation, indicating a physical interaction between Vps41 and Apl5 (Fig. 7a). Other AP-3 subunits did not interact with Vps41, as judged by a two-hybrid assay. To further define the interacting region within Apl5, we generated a series of truncation constructs of Apl5 and assayed these for interaction with Vps41. The minimal binding region for Vps41 within Apl5 was mapped to the C-terminal 82 amino acids (Fig. 7a). Apl5 constructs that lacked this region were unable to support reporter gene activation. To corroborate these results independently, we expressed fulllength Apl5, the C-terminal 125 amino acids of Apl5, and a C-terminal truncation construct of Apl5 as GST-fusions and purified them from Escherichia coli. The isolated Apl5 fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione­Sepharose beads and subsequently incubated with a detergent-solubilized 150,000g membrane pellet (P150) obtained from cells expressing a Vps41­Myc fusion protein.

Figure 8 Vps41 functions together with AP-3 in the ALP pathway. The AP-3dependent ALP pathway bypasses the endosome and is independent of most CPY pathway components. Both of the known protein cargoes of the pathway--ALP and Vam3--contain di-leucine sorting signals which direct their sorting into AP-3-coated vesicles that form at the trans-Golgi. Formation of these AP-3-coated vesicles, but not AP-3 association with this compartment, requires the function of Vps41. Vam3 is required at the vacuole for fusion of ALP pathway intermediates. Inhibition of the fusion reaction in vam3tsf cells leads to accumulation of AP-3-coated ALP pathway intermediates. Vps41 binds to Apl5 on the trans-Golgi and the AP-3 vesicle. We suggest that Vps41 might represent a factor required for recruitment of a nonclathrin coat onto AP-3-coated vesicles, or might itself be a component of the coat.

Figure 7 Vps41 binds to Apl5 in vivo and in vitro. a, Two-hybrid analysis of the interaction between Apl5 and Vps41. The -galactosidase activity in PCY2 double transformants is the average of triplicate measurements for at least three independent transformants harbouring each set of plasmids. The Gal4­DB­Apl5 fusion (encoding amino acids 1­854) showed strong transcriptional autoactivation (auto). aa, amino acids; CC, predicted coiled-coil. b, The indicated fragments of Apl5 fused to GST were isolated from E. coli and immobilized on GST­Sepharose. A solubilized P150 fraction from yeast cells expressing a Vps41­Myc fusion protein was incubated with the immobilized GST fusions at 4°C and washed. Bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer. Ten per cent of the eluate was loaded per lane; the amount of solubilized extract (Total) loaded as a reference on the gel corresponds to 10% of input into each binding experiment. The top panel shows a western blot probed with anti-Myc antibodies; the bottom panel shows the Coomassie-stained gel of the input of isolated GST fusion proteins. The amino acids present in each Apl5­ GST fusion protein are indicated numerically to the right of the lower panel. c, Vps41 co-precipitates membranes containing AP-3 vesicle markers. Accudenz gradient fractions from vam3tsf cells expressing a Vps41­Myc fusion protein integrated into the chromosomal locus of VPS41 (DKY34 + pVAM3-6.414) were incubated with Dynabeads coated with anti-Myc antibodies. After washing the beads and subsequent incubation in the presence or absence of 0.5% Triton-X100, beads (P) were separated from the soluble fraction (S) and resuspended or diluted, respectively, in SDS sample buffer. Twenty per cent of the fractions were loaded per lane.

Samples were washed, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS­ sample buffer. Eluates were then analysed for the presence of Vps41­Myc. As shown in Fig. 6b, Vps41 only bound to GST­Apl5

fusion proteins that contained the C-terminal 78 amino acids (Fig. 7b). This analysis supports the results of the two-hybrid assay and shows that Vps41 associates with the C terminus of Apl5 in vitro. Finally, expression in yeast of an Apl5­HA fusion protein deleted for the C-terminal 82 amino acids of Apl5 resulted in a kinetic defect in ALP transport to the vacuole (data not shown). Thus, the Vps41-binding activity of Apl5 is relevant for transport in vivo.

dures similar to ours, but have only been seen from in vitro budding reactions which use chemicals (GTP-S) or mutant proteins (Arf or Sar1) to stabilize the coat structures1,24­26. Our experimental approach of isolating an in vivo vesicular intermediate did not allow any chemical stabilization of non-clathrin coats, which may explain why no obvious coat-like structures could be found by electron microscopy (see also ref. 27). Alternatively, it is possible that AP-3 alone is not sufficient to provide a distinctive coat morphology. In summary, several lines of evidence establish the authenticity of the AP-3 vesicular intermediate. First, transport vesicles containing precursor ALP accumulate only when transport to the vacuole is disrupted in the vam3tsf mutant at non-permissive temperature. Second, the 50­130-nm vesicles can be isolated by immunoprecipitation with cargo (Vam3) or associated AP-3 proteins (Apl5­HA) and isolated vesicles contain both cargo and AP-3 proteins. Third, the purified vesicles were neither Golgi nor endosomal membranes, as protein markers for these compartments were not recovered. These data support previous models based on genetic evidence for protein transport through this pathway, in which AP-3 acts at the Golgi compartment to concentrate cargo into transport vesicles that are destined for the vacuole9. In contrast to proteins such as Vam3, which affect both the ALP and CPY pathways, a temperature-conditional allele of VPS41 was shown to affect ALP trafficking only5. We found that, unlike vam3tsf, which displays two defined peaks of pALP in gradients -- a vesicular fraction and a Golgi fraction (Figs 4a, 6) -- both vam3tsfapm3 and vam3tsf vps41tsf double-mutant cells primarily accumulate pALP and Vam3 in the Golgi fraction (Fig. 6). Therefore, in both strains, the formation of AP-3-associated vesicular intermediates seems to be inhibited. This suggests that, like AP-3, Vps41 may act at an early step of the ALP pathway, possibly in the formation of AP-3-coated vesicles at the Golgi. Importantly, the association of AP-3 with membranes was not affected in vps41tsf cells, as more than 80% of AP-3 was still associated with the Golgi fraction (Fig. 5c). Furthermore, AP-3 remains associated with a membrane fraction in the complete absence of Vps41 (P.R. and S.D.E., unpublished results). Therefore, Vps41 function does not seem to be required for binding of AP-3 to cargo proteins and membranes. Consistent with these data, we were able to demonstrate in vivo and in vitro that Vps41 associates with the AP-3 complex by binding to the extreme C terminus of Apl5 (Fig. 7a,b). Moreover, when we analysed the distribution of Vps41 itself in gradient fractions obtained from vam3tsf cells, we found that the distribution of Vps41 was similar to that of the ALP pathway components AP-3, pALP and Vam3, in that it localized to the Golgi as well as to the AP-3-vesicle-enriched fractions (Fig. 4a). Moreover, in immunoisolation experiments we could demonstrate that Vps41, AP-3, pALP and Vam3 reside on a common membrane (Fig. 7c). Therefore, because Vps41 is not required for AP-3 binding to membranes, AP-3 binding is likely to precede Vps41 binding. In the current view of the topology of AP complexes, the C termini of the  and  subunits are believed to form the most peripheral domain of an AP-coated membrane and are therefore most accessible for protein interactions2,28,29. Our domain mapping suggests that a predicted coiled-coil structure30 within the C terminus of Apl5 may be the structural motif that mediates Vps41 binding. This motif is present in the C terminus of human, Drosophila and mouse -adaptin, but not in the corresponding AP-1 and AP-2 subunits (- and -adaptin), suggesting that it is a conserved AP-3-specific feature. Our results suggest that Vps41 is not required for AP-3 binding to the trans-Golgi, but is required for the formation of AP-3 vesicles (Fig. 8). These observations are consistent with two different models for Vps41 function. First, Vps41 could serve as a factor that is involved in the budding reaction and might be responsible for recruitment of an additional, as yet unidentified, coat component or other factor. Alternatively, Vps41 might itself represent a component of the non-clathrin coat linked to the AP-3 complex

As Vps41 binds AP-3, it is possible that Vps41 also associates with the AP-3 transport vesicle. We therefore analysed the localization of Vps41 in gradients. A functional Vps41­HA fusion protein was expressed from the VPS41 genomic locus in vam3tsf cells and was analysed by the sucrose-gradient fractionation procedure. We found that Vps41 was predominantly localized to the Golgi-containing fraction, but that a significant portion co-migrated with AP3, pALP and Vam3 in the vesicular fraction (Fig. 4a). Vesicular localization of Vps41 was further addressed by immunoisolation experiments from Accudenz gradients of vam3tsf mutant cells. Membranes immunoisolated with Vam3 antibodies (as shown in Fig. 2b) contained significant amounts of a Vps41­Myc fusion protein (data not shown). Furthermore, in a reciprocal experiment, Vps41­Myc co-precipitated the ALP pathway cargoes Vam3 and pALP in a Triton-X100-releasable manner as well as Apl6 as a representative component of AP-3 (Fig. 7c). These data further demonstrate that Vps41 localizes to the same membrane intermediates as the other known AP-3 pathway proteins.

Discussion In this study, we provide the first biochemical and morphological evidence of a vesicular intermediate in the AP-3-dependent ALP pathway. To generate a defined block in transport through the ALP pathway we used a conditional mutant form of the vacuolar tSNARE Vam3 (ref. 18), which is affected in the docking and fusion of transport intermediates with the vacuole. As anticipated in this mutant, biosynthetic transport of ALP and Vam3 could be arrested in a prevacuolar compartment (Fig. 1). Using a series of gradient fractionation steps, we significantly enriched a low-density vesicular fraction containing ALP pathway cargoes together with the AP3 proteins (Fig. 4). As expected, deletion of AP-3 inhibited formation of the light vesicle fraction; instead, both Vam3 and pALP remained predominantly in Kex2-containing Golgi-membrane fractions (Fig. 6). These data strongly suggest that the low-density fractions represent AP-3-dependent transport intermediates and that the pathway originates in a trans-Golgi compartment, for when transport is blocked, ALP pathway cargo proteins accumulate in the Golgi. Membranes containing the ALP pathway cargoes Vam3 and pALP, as well as the AP-3 proteins Apl5 and Apl6, were isolated by immunoprecipitation. Detergent solubilization of the proteins immunoprecipitated by the AP-3 complex resulted in solubilization of both Vam3 and ALP, demonstrating the coexistence of these proteins in a membrane compartment (Fig. 2). However, a pool of pALP and Vam3 proteins was refractory to detergent, suggesting that some protein­protein interactions exist between the AP-3 complex and cargoes. This is consistent with protein­protein interactions that have been previously shown for AP-3 and its cargoes22. These membranes were primarily in the form of small, 50­130-nm diameter, electron-dense vesicles. Furthermore, the membrane vesicles isolated with Apl5­HA could also be labelled with the membrane protein Vam3, demonstrating the coexistence of these two proteins on the same membrane compartment. Despite the fact that the vesicles could be purified by immunoprecipitation of an AP-3 subunit (Apl5) and the AP-3 subunits Apl5 and Apl6 were present in all vesicle preparations, thin sections of immunoprecipitated vesicles did not show obvious coat structures (Fig. 3). We used physiological buffers and a rapid isolation procedure to maintain the membrane association of coat components throughout our purification procedure. Clathrin-coated vesicles can be isolated from cells intact, with distinct coat structures that can be seen by electron microscopy2. In spite of this apparent stability, neither morphological nor biochemical analysis of isolated vesicles revealed the presence of clathrin, consistent with previous data that clathrin is not involved in transport through the ALP pathway13,16,23. Non-clathrin coat proteins, such as COPI and COPII, have not been visualized using in vivo enrichment proce-

through Apl5 (Fig. 8). In fact, Vps41 and its homologues in Caenorhabditis elegans, D. melanogaster and various plant species contain a clathrin heavy-chain homology region (CHCR) which is thought to be involved in oligomerization and thus in formation of the clathrin lattice31,32. We have shown that a 50­130-nm AP-3 vesicular intermediate directs transport of ALP pathway cargoes from the Golgi to the vacuole. Formation of the vesicle requires both AP-3 and Vps41, a new component of the AP-3-dependent pathway. Vps41 binds to AP-3 and thus is a candidate for a component of an AP-3-specific coat. Furthermore, these data also implicate Vps41 in melanosomal and platelet granule biogenesis pathways in mammalian cells and thus, like AP-3, it may be involved in human disorders such as HPS.

on top of a sucrose step gradient consisting of several concentration steps (wt/wt) which were, from bottom to top, as follows: 0.5ml 60%; 1ml 37%; 1.5ml 34%; 2ml 32%; 2ml 29%; 1ml 27%; 1.5ml 22%. This gradient was centrifuged at 160,000g for 18h at 4°C. The gradient was collected manually from the top into 14 fractions. The fractions were TCA-precipitated and processed for SDS­PAGE and immunoblotting. Protein content of fractions was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay reagent (Bio-Rad) with BSA as protein standard.

Methods

Strains, media and materials. The following strains were used in these studies: SEY6210 (ref. 33); PRY1 (SEY6210, APL5-HA3::HIS3); PRY3 (SEY6210, VAM3::LEU2, APL5-HA3::HIS3); PRY9 (SEY6210, VPS41::LEU2, APL5HA3::HIS3); GOY4 (SEY6210, APL5::HIS3) (ref. 9); DKY24 (SEY6210, VPS41-MYC13::HIS3MX6); DKY32 (SEY6210, VAM3::LEU2, VPS41-HA3::HIS3MX6); DKY34 (SEY6210, VAM3::LEU2, VPS41MYC13::HIS3MX6); GOY10 (SEY6210, APM3::HIS3, VAM3::LEU2); WSY92 (SEY6210, VAM3::LEU2, VPS41::LEU2). Strains were grown in standard yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) or synthetic medium (YNB) supplemented with amino acids depending on the auxotrophic requirements of the strains. Standard bacterial medium supplemented with 100 µg ml­1 ampicillin was used to grow E. coli strains and to maintain plasmids. Plasmids and DNA manipulation. Plasmids carrying the vam3tsf or vps41tsf allele have been previously published5,18. To HA-tag Apl5, a primer complementary to sequence 50 base pairs (bp) upstream of the APL5 stop codon, followed by a region complementary to HA sequence, and a second primer complementary to a region ofAPL5 150 bp downstream of the stop codon and to a small region of HIS3 sequence together, were used to amplify a triple-HA-encoding region followed by the HIS3 gene from plasmid pMB107 containing the HA­HIS3 construct in pBluescriptSK (Stratagene) (M. Babst and S.D.E., unpublished work). Integration of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cassette into the APL5 genomic locus was achieved by transformation of SEY6210 or other strains with the PCR product. Transformants were selected for His prototrophy, analysed for expression of Apl5-HA, and assayed for protein function by ALP pulse-chase immunoprecipitation34. Tagging of Vps41 with a triple HA sequence or 13 Myc epitopes was performed by genomic integration at the 3 end of the VPS41 open reading frame (removing the stop codon). PCR products containing a HIS3 marker gene and the tags, flanked by VPS41 homologue regions, were generated as described earlier35, using the templates described therein. Subcellular fractionation. For fractionation experiments, approximately 20 OD600 of cells were collected from cultures grown in YNB at 26°C to an OD600of 0.6. After dithiothreitol (DTT) treatment for 10min at room temperature (in 0.1M Tris-HCl pH9.4, 10mM DTT), cells were spheroplasted at 26°C in spheroplasting media (1× YNB, 2% glucose, amino acids, 1M sorbitol, 20mM Tris-HCl pH7.5 and 1µg per OD600 Zymolyase). Spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in labelling medium (1× YNB, 2% glucose, amino acids, 1M sorbitol,) to 3OD600 per ml and incubated in a 38°C waterbath for 1h. The spheroplasts were then chilled on ice for 5min and collected at 4°C. Spheroplasts were lysed in HEPES lysis buffer (20mM HEPES­KOH pH6.8, 50mM potassium acetate, 0.2nM sorbitol, 2mM EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (to the following final concentration: 5µgml­1 antipain, 1µgml­1 aprotinin, 0.5µgml­1 leupeptin, 10µgml­1 2-macroglobulin, and 0.1mM AEBSF (4-(2-amino ethyl) benzene sulphonyl fluoride hydrochloride)) with 15 strokes with a Kontes glass dounce homogenizer on ice. After a clearing spin at 300g for 5min, the lysate was subjected to sequential centrifugation at 13,000g (15min) and 100,000g (45min) to generate low- and high-speed supernatant and pellet fractions. The resulting fractions were precipitated with TCA, washed with ice-cold acetone and resuspended in SDS­ PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were analysed by SDS­PAGE and immunoblotting using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection according to the manufacturer's specifications (Amersham). Western blots were quantified by densitometry using NIH Image (Scion Image 1.62a). Accudenz gradient centrifugation. Accudenzwas purchased from Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corporation (Westbury, NY). Solutions were prepared wt/vol. in HEPES lysis buffer with protease inhibitors (see above). Gradients consisted of several concentration steps which were, from bottom to top, as follows: 0.5ml 60%; 1ml 43%; 1ml 37%; 1ml 31%; 1ml 27%; 1ml 23%; 1ml 20%; 1ml 17%; 1ml 13%; 1ml 7%. A 1.5-ml 300g supernatant (see above for preparation) corresponding to approximately 60 OD600 was loaded on the top of the gradient. The gradient was centrifuged for 19h at 170,000g at 4°C in a Beckman SW41 rotor. Twelve fractions were collected from the top of the gradient, TCA-precipitated, and processed for SDS­PAGE and immunoblotting or subjected to immunoisolation without further dilution. Fractionation in sucrose gradients. For fractionation of lysates on two successive sucrose gradients, 500 to 1,000 OD600 were spheroplasted and lysed as described above. A 2-ml 13,000g supernatant fraction was generated in HEPES lysis buffer and loaded on top of a sucrose step gradient consisting of 1.5ml 30% (wt/vol.) sucrose layered on top of 1 ml 60% (wt/vol.) sucrose, in HEPES lysis buffer. The gradient was spun for 2h at 150,000g at 4°C in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor. The gradient was manually collected from the top into a 2.4-ml soluble fraction (S), a 1.2-ml membrane fraction (M) and a 0.9-ml pellet fraction (P). The membrane fraction was adjusted with HEPES lysis buffer to a sucrose concentration of 10% (wt/wt). A 1.5-ml sample was loaded

Immunoisolation of AP-3 membranes. For immunoisolation, Dynabeads M-450 sheep anti-mouse or Dynabeads M-280 sheep anti-rabbit were incubated with 0.6µg antibody per 107 beads in HEPES lysis buffer supplemented with 0.1% BSA at 4°C overnight. Antibodies used were: anti-HA (Boehringer Mannheim); affinity-pure anti-Vam3 (ref. 18) and mouse or rabbit IgG (Jackson) as negative controls. Dynabeads were subsequently washed with HEPES lysis buffer three times to remove unbound antibody before use in experiments. For each immunoisolation, 75µl Dynabead suspension (5 × 107 M-280 or 3 × 107 M-450) was added to aliquots of the gradient fraction and rotated for 1.5h at 4°C. After incubation, the samples were washed with HEPES lysis buffer three times, transferred to siliconized tubes, and given an additional wash in the presence or absence of 0.5% Triton-X100, for 10min at room temperature. Bound proteins were eluted with 100µl SDS sample buffer, and supernatants (50µl) were diluted 1:2 with SDS sample buffer. 20% of each fraction was loaded on a SDS gel and processed for immunoblotting. For electron microscope morphological analysis the beads were fixed following the third wash (see below). Electron microscopy. For conventional morphology analysis, Dynabeads containing isolated membranes were fixed and processed as described previously36. Ultrathin sections were stained with 2% acidic uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed in a JEOL 1200 EX-II electron microscope (JEOL USA, Peabody, MA). For immunocytochemistry, Dynabeads coated with anti-HA antibody and containing vesicles isolated from vam3tsf cells were washed with cacodylate buffer and incubated with affinity-purified anti-Vam3 antibodies (diluted 1:25) for 1h at room temperature. The beads were washed and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to 5-nm gold particles (Amersham) (diluted 1:50) in cacodylate buffer. Following antibody incubation, beads were fixed and processed for electron microscopy as above. Antibodies. The generation of polyclonal anti-CPS, anti-Vam3 and anti-Apl6 antisera and their affinity purification have been published5,9,18. Monoclonal anti-HA antibodies (Boehringer Mannheim), monoclonal antiALP antibody (Molecular Probes) and monoclonal anti-Myc antibody 9E10 (Genosys) were purchased. Affinity-pure anti-Kex2 antibody was provided by G. Payne. Two-hybrid analysis and cloning of GAL4­APL5 constructs. For subcloning of full-length APL5 as well as selected APL5 fragments into the yeast two-hybrid bait vector pGBT9 (Clontech), we generated defined PCR products by using sets of sense primers that contained an EcoRI site followed by a SmaI site, upstream of the APL5 sequence, and antisense primers with an XhoI and PstI site, downstream of the APL5 sequence. PCR products were digested with SmaI and PstI and cloned into pGBT9 for in-frame fusion with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. The resulting plasmids were pPR11 (encoding full-length APL5, amino acids 1­932), pPR15 (729­932), pPR16 (807­ 932), pPR17 (850­932), pPR19 (1­854), pPR23 (729­850). A. Wurmser provided full-length VPS41 cloned into pGADGH (Clontech). Plasmids were transformed into the yeast reporter strain PCY2 (ref. 37). Colonies were assayed for -galactosidase activity by filter assay38 and quantitative -galactosidase assay39. All assays were done in triplicate on at least three independent transformants. Heterologous expression of APL5 fragments and in vitro binding studies. To generate GST fusions of Apl5 for expression in E. coli, fragments were excised from the two-hybrid constructs (see above) with SmaI and XhoI and ligated into pGEX4T1 (Pharmacia). The resulting constructs were: pPR20 (encoding amino acids 807­932), pPR21 (1­932), pPR22 (729­932), pPR24 (729­850), pPR29 (1­854). GST-fusion proteins were expressed and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia). Yeast extracts for Apl5-binding experiments were generated from 1,000OD600 of cells containing the integrated Vps41­Myc fusion. Cells were resuspended in 2ml lysis buffer (20mM HEPES­KOH pH6.8, 50mM potassium acetate, 2mM EDTA plus 1× complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Boehringer Mannheim)). Glass beads (1g; 0.5mm diameter) were added and samples were vigorously vortexed 15 times for 30s with 1min cooling on ice between rounds. This lysate was cleared for 10min at 12,000g at 4°C and the supernatant was subjected to a 150,000g spin for 45min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer plus 1% Triton-X100 and cleared again at 13,000g. Approximately 100OD600 of the resulting supernatant was incubated with either GST or the various forms of Apl5 that had been bound to glutathione­Sepharose as described for 1h at 4°C. After incubation, Sepharose beads were washed four times with lysis buffer containing 1% Triton-X100 and bound material was eluted with Laemmli sample buffer.
