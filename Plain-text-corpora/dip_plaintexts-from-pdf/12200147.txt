Abstract It has recently been demonstrated that a fragment of the proteasome, called the APIS complex, plays an important role in RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. Here, it is shown that the APIS complex is physically associated with many general transcription factors, including components of yeast FACT (Cdc68/Pob3), TFIID, TFIIH, and the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. Depletion of this APIS/transcription factor complex from a yeast whole cell extract resulted in reduced transcription, indicating that it is functionally relevant. The APIS/transcription factor complex does not include detectable levels of the 20S proteolytic sub-unit of the proteasome. Furthermore, immunopurified 26S proteasome contains little or no transcription factors, suggesting that transcription factors and the 20S bind competitively to the APIS complex. These data add to the growing body of evidence that the APIS complex has a role in transcription, independent of its role in proteolysis and, furthermore, argues that it functions in association with the general transcription complex.

The RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription of RNA-encoding genes is a complex and highly regulated process involving over 100 individual polypeptides. A major challenge is to characterize the various multiprotein complexes involved in this process and to determine their detailed mechanisms of action. Several years ago, alleles of SUG1 and SUG2 (sug1-1 and sug21, respectively), were discovered as suppressors of gal4D, which encodes a crippled form of the yeast Gal4 activator that lacks most of the C-terminal activation domain (AD) [1]. Subsequently, a search for suppressors of a temperature-sensitive cdc68 mutant, which encodes a general transcription factor, turned up a different allele of SUG1 (sug1-20) [2]. The Sug1 and Sug2 proteins are components of the 26S proteasome, which is responsible for most non-lysosomal cellular proteolysis [3], possibly suggesting a direct involvement of the proteasome in RNA polymerase II transcription. The proteasome is composed of two sub-assemblies, the 20S core particle, which includes all of the proteases,

and the 19S regulatory particle [4], which sits on either side of the barrel-like 20S and regulates the access of substrates to the proteolytic sites inside the cavity of the 20S. Proteins in the so-called ``lid'' sub-complex [5] of the 19S associate with and hydrolyze polyubiquitin chains, the post-translational modification that marks proteins for degradation. Six ATPases in the ``base'' of the 19S particle serve to unwind (unfold) the substrates and feed the resultant unstructured chains into the proteolytic cavity for destruction [3,6­8]. Sug1 and Sug2 are two of these six ATPases. Given the fact that Sug1 and Sug2 function are crucial to proteasome-mediated proteolysis, one might explain the genetic suppression data as being due to reduced proteolysis of structurally destabilized forms of Gal4 and Cdc68, thus, allowing the crippled proteins to function [9]. However, genetic analyses do not support the ``indirect proteolysis'' model for suppression of cdc68-1 and gal4D by sug1-20 and sug1-1, respectively [2,10]. Second, the role of Cdc68 in transcription has been clarified with the discovery that it is the yeast analogue of one of the two polypeptides in the mammalian elongation factor FACT [11]. FACT can stimulate transcription in vitro by at least two different mechanisms. On chromatin templates it allows the movement

of elongating polymerase through pause sites, apparently by interacting with nucleosomes and altering their structure [12]. Second, it can collaborate with another elongation factor, P-TEFb, to counteract the inhibitory effect of the DSIF/NELF complex, which binds to hypophosphorylated RNA polymerase II and promotes pausing even on naked DNA templates [13]. This new information, together with the genetic interaction between CDC68 and SUG1, suggested that the Sug proteins might be involved in elongation. This idea was strongly supported by our recent report that Sug1 activity is essential for efficient RNA polymerase II elongation in a crude extract in vitro [14]. Specifically, in extracts lacking functional Sug1 protein, transcription stalled approximately 50 nucleotides downstream of the start site. Addition of immunopurified 19S complex or 26S proteasome re-established efficient elongation. This effect of Sug1 on elongation was not the result of a critical proteolytic step, since impairment of proteasome-mediated peptidase activity using chemical inhibitors or mutations in proteolytic sub-units had no effect on transcription. A number of lines of evidence argue that these in vitro observations are relevant to the situation in vivo. Certain alleles of SUG1 and SUG2 confer sensitivity to 6-azauracil [15,16] and impair the expression of PUR5 [17]. Both phenotypes correlate strongly with impaired elongation in vivo. Recently, we have used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to demonstrate that Sug1, Sug2, and the other proteasomal ATPases are recruited to the GAL1 promoter and gene in yeast upon induction of Gal4 activity with galactose [18]. Sug1 was found to be associated with the entire length of the GAL1 gene under inducing conditions, consistent with it acting as part of the elongation complex [19,20]. Association of the ATPases with the DNA was completely dependent on Gal4 protein, indicating that they were recruited through direct or indirect associations with the activator, consistent with previous reports of Gal4 activation domain-Sug1 and -Sug2 interactions [21,22]. Strikingly, proteins from the 20S core complex and the lid sub-complex of the 19S were not present on the induced GAL1 promoter or gene. In addition, proteinbinding assays showed that the Gal4 AD associates with only a sub-complex of the proteasome that includes the six ATPases and possibly other factors such as Rpn1 and Rpn2. The lid proteins [23] and 20S were excluded from the Gal4 activation domain-associated complex, even when the input was intact, immunopurified 19S or 26S complex [18]. We have termed this transcriptionassociated sub-complex of the proteasome APIS (ATPases independent of 20S). While it is now established that the Sug1 and other proteasomal ATPases associate with Gal4, as well as several other transcription activators [24­29], potential interactions with the general transcription machinery

are less well established, although Tamura and coworkers [30] (also see [31]) have demonstrated that Sug1 and some of the other proteasomal ATPases associate with TATA-binding protein (TBP) in extracts and Yanagi et al. [32] have reported co-immunoprecipitation of the Mss1 ATPase and some transcription factors. Therefore, we have carried out a number of experiments reported here to probe for possible interactions between the general transcription factors and APIS, using the Sug1 protein as a bellweather. We demonstrate that a substantial fraction of the Sug1 protein in yeast extracts is associated with general transcription factors. These complexes do not contain detectable 20S proteasome core substituents, supporting further the case that the role of APIS in transcription is non-proteolytic.

Experimental procedures DNAs. The reporter plasmid used for in vitro transcription assays was derived from pJJ470. A fragment that contains two Pho4p-binding sites was amplified by PCR from the Pho5 promoter region of yeast genomicDNA using the following primers,which containa HindIII site, primer 1: 50-CCGCAAGCTTCGAAGGTAAAAGGTTCATAGCGC and a XhoI site: primer 2: 50-GCCGCTCGAGGGGTATATGCCTTG CCAAGTAAGGTG. The resulting DNA fragment was digested with HindIII and XhoI, and cloned into pJJ470 to give pJJpho4. The GST3HA-Pho4 (3HA, three copies of the hemagglutinin epitope) expression constructwasderivedfrompGEX-CS(Pharmacia).ATEVprotease[50] recognition site was placed in the linker region between GST and a NcoI site: 50-CTC GAG AAT CTT ATA TTT CAG GGC GGG CAT GCC ATG GCA. The DNA fragment that contains the Pho4p coding region was amplified from yeast genomic DNA using Pfu polymerase. The following primers were employed: 50-CATGCCATGGGATACGAGC TCGGCCGTACAACTTCTG AGGGAATAC (NcoI site shown in bold) and 50-CGCGGATCCTCACGTTCTGCTGTAGGTGACGG (BamH1 site shown in bold). The PCR product was treated with NcoI and BamH1, and ligated into the parent vector, providing pGEX-Pho4. Two primers contain Nco1 sites, 50-CATGCCATGGGACTCGAGAA AATGTACCCATACGATG and 50-ACGTCCATGGACATCTCGA CAGCGTAATCTGGAACwereusedtoamplifyafragmentcontaining the 3HA tag from pRS313-3HA-TAFII90 [38,51,52]. The PCR product was treated with NcoI and inserted into pGEX-Pho4, to provide pGEX3HA-Pho4. Proteins. Pho4 pGEX-3HA-Ph04 was transformed into BL21 cells. A 5ml overnight culture was added to one liter of LB-Amp and the cells were grown until the OD600 reached 0.8. IPTG was then added to a final concentration of 1 mM. The culture was grown for another 1 h at 37°C and then the cells were pelleted by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in PBS and sonicated. After centrifugation to remove cell debris, 1 ml glutathione beads was incubated with the clear supernatant for 1h at 4°C. The beads were washed with PBS+ 1% Triton-X 100 four times and with PBS three times. Twenty ll TEV protease ð10U=llÞ (Life Technologies) was incubated with the beads for 30 min at 30°C. The supernatant was then collected and concentrated. SDS­PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue indicated that the protein was approximately 70% pure. The purified protein included the following residues fused to the N-terminus of native Pho4p GHA MGGLEKMYPYDVPDYAVEMSMGYEL. A plasmid expressing GST­Rad23Ubl [35] was transformed into E. coli BL21 and 50ml of an overnight culture was inoculated into one liter of LB­ampicillin. The cells were grown for 3 h and then IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. The cells were then grown for

another 3h. The purification was carried out exactly as described above for GST-3HA-Pho4. 19S purification. The yeast 19S complex was immunopurified, as described previously [14]. Immunoprecipitation. Whole cell extracts [37] from strains that express either HA3-TBP or HA3-TAFII90 [38,51,52] were pre-incubated with protein A positive S. aureus cells for 30min, then with anti-HA antibody immobilized on protein A positive S. aureus cells for 1 h at 4°C. The S. aureus cells were washed three times and the retained proteins were analyzed by SDS­PAGE and Western blotting using the appropriate antibodies. ``Pull-down'' experiments using GST fusion proteins. All such experiments were performed in MTB buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100mM potassium acetate, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1mM DTT, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% NP-40). A whole cell extract was incubated with the GST fusion protein bound to glutathione­ agarose beads for 1 h at 4°. The beads were then washed with MTB buffer three times. When ATP was included, its concentration was 1mM, an ATP regenerating system was added [53], and the beads were washed with MTB buffer plus 1mM ATP. To analyze proteins retained by the bead-bound GST fusion proteins, the beads were boiled in SDScontaining gel loading buffer, the beads were pelleted by centrifugation in a microfuge, and the resulting supernatant was electrophoresed through a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and Western blotting using the appropriate antibodies was employed to visualize the retained proteins. In the experiment involving sequential GST­Rad23Ubl affinity chromatography followed by immunoprecipitation, whole cell extract made from the HA3-TBP-expressing yeast was incubated with beadbound GST­Rad23Ubl, as described above. After the beads were washed thoroughly, bound proteins were eluted with 5mM glutathione in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0). The elute was concentrated using a Centrocon device (Millipore, 100K cut-off). The subsequent immunoprecipitation employed anti-HA antibody and was carried out, as described above. Immobilization of 19S on Dynabeads. Affinity-purified 19S [14] was incubated with a 50-fold molar excess of sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) on ice for two hours. The solution was then passed through a G-25 centri-sep spin column (Princeton Separations) to remove the free biotin molecules. Biotinylated 19S was incubated with streptavidincoated Dynabeads for 2h at 4 °C. Partial Depletion of 19S from a whole cell extract. Whole cell extract (20 mg total protein) was diluted with Buffer 40 (20mM Hepes, PH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM DTT, 120mM potassium glutamate, and 1mM magnesium acetate) to 400ll and passed through 200ll GST-saturated or GST­Rad23Ubl-saturated glutathione­agarose beads packed in a one ml syringe. This was repeated three times. The flow-through was passed through another 300ll GST and GST­Rad23Ubl column three times and then finally passed though 100ll glutathione column once to trap free GST and GST­Rad23Ubl protein. The flow-through was concentrated and the protein level was determined by the Bradford method. The same amount of total protein was input in Western blot and in vitro transcription assays. In vitro transcription. Yeast whole cell extract was prepared from strain W303A. Extract preparation and in vitro transcription experiments were carried out as described by Woontner et al. [37]. HindIII (0:25lg) treated plasmid plus 0:75lg puc19 plasmid DNA was employed in activated transcription reactions. When Pho4 protein was present, 100ng was added).

Results Co-immunoprecipitation (co-Ip) is a classic method for assessing interactions between proteins in a crude extract. As mentioned above, Ip of epitope-tagged Cdc68 (one of the FACT sub-units) results in the co-Ip

of Sug1, suggesting an association of FACT and APIS. To more generally examine APIS­transcription factor (TF) interactions, we therefore wished to immunoprecipitate the APIS complex and examine the associated proteins for the presence of various components of the general transcription machinery. However, as will be reported elsewhere, we have evidence that the use of antibodies raised against the proteasomal ATPases or monoclonals that recognize N-terminally tagged ATPases for this purpose disrupts native interactions. An alternative possibility was to employ as a specific ``pulldown'' reagent the N-terminal domain (residues 1­77), of the yeast DNA repair protein Rad23. This ubiquitinlike (Ubl) domain has previously been reported to be a specific ligand for the yeast proteasome [33­35] and has been implicated in modulating the activity of the proteasomal ATPases during transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair [35,36]. As shown in Fig. 1A, the binding site of the Rad23 Ubl domain must be in the 19S regulatory particle, since exposure of glutathione­agarose-immobilized GST­Rad23Ubl to immunopurified 19S complex lacking detectable 20S proteins [14] resulted in the retention of Sug1, whereas no binding to GST was observed. Furthermore, the addition of a large excess of GST­Rad23Ubl to an in vitro transcription reaction had no effect on the output of mRNA (data not shown), arguing that the Ubl domain does not compete with TFs for APIS. Finally, exposure of glutathione­ agarose-immobilized GST­Rad23Ubl to a transcriptionally active yeast extract [37] resulted in the retention of the Cdc68 protein in addition to the proteasomal ATPases Sug1 and Cim5 (Fig. 1B), whereas these proteins were absent when immobilized GST­GFP was used. Taken together, these data suggest that Rad23Ubl can interact with transcription complexes containing Sug1. Therefore, we assayed for the presence of a number of other TFs in the GST­Rad23Ubl-associated fraction. Western blotting with antibodies raised against TATA-binding protein (TBP), the Tfb2 protein (a subunit of TFIIH), Med8p (a mediator component), and Rpb1p (the largest sub-unit of RNA polymerase II) revealed that each of these proteins was also present in the GST­Rad23Ubl-associated fraction (Fig. 1B). None of these proteins were retained to a significant level by a control protein composed of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to GST. Gal6p and cyclophilin, two abundant proteins that are not transcription factors, were not present in the Rad23Ubl-retained fraction. By comparing the intensity of the bands and correcting for the fraction of the sample loaded in the input and GST­ Rad23Ubl lanes, it was estimated that approximately 15% of Cdc68, 10% of TBP, Tfb2, and Med8, and 50% of Sug1 and Cim5 in the extract were retained by GST­ Rad23Ubl. The detection of these transcription factors in the GST­Rad23Ubl-bound fraction is consistent with the

Fig. 1. The N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (Ubl) of Rad23 protein, a known proteasome ligand, specifically retains general transcription factors from a yeast extract. (A) Immunopurified 19S complex was incubated with GST or a fusion of GST to the Rad23Ubl bound to beads. 19S was retained by GST-Rad23Ubl, as evidenced by the retention of Sug1, a 19S component, confirming that the GST­ Rad23Ubl fusion protein is a competent 19S ligand. A Western blot using antibody raised against Sug1 is shown. (B) Yeast extract was incubated with GST­GFP (green fluorescent protein) or GST­Rad23Ubl bound to beads. After a thorough washing, the retention of the proteins indicated was determined by SDS­PAGE/Western blot analysis using the appropriate antibodies.

idea that they are associated with the APIS complex. However, while there is no evidence that Rad23 binds transcription factors directly, the possibility that these results reflect distinct Rad23Ubl-proteasome and Rad23Ubl-transcription factor complexes cannot be ruled out. To probe this point, the experiment shown schematically in Fig. 2A was carried out. A whole cell extract was made from a yeast strain expressing a triply hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged TBP [38]. First, Rad23Ubl-binding proteins were enriched by incubating the extract with bead-bound GST­Rad23Ubl, washing thoroughly, and then eluting all of the bound proteins with glutathione. Western blotting revealed that Sug1, Tfb2, HA3-TBP and, of course, a large amount of GST­Rad23Ubl were present in this fraction (Fig. 2B,

lane 1). Anti-HA monoclonal antibody was then used to immunoprecipitate the tagged TBP from this Rad23Ublbinding fraction. If the transcription factors, Sug1 (APIS), and GST­Rad23Ubl, are all part of a single complex, then all of these proteins should appear in the immunoprecipitated fraction. On the other hand, if the glutathione-eluted material consists of distinct Rad23Ubl-transcription factor and Rad23Ubl­19S complexes, then GST­Rad23Ubl should co-immunoprecipitate with HA3-TBP, but Sug1 should not. As shown in Fig. 2B, the results are consistent with the model in which all of the proteins reside in a single complex. A significant fraction of the Sug1 in the glutathione-eluted fraction co-immunoprecipitated with TBP, as did some of the GST­Rad23Ubl protein and Tfb2 (lane 2). The same conclusion was reached by carrying out a co-Ip experiment directly from the extract. Fig. 3 (top) demonstrates that Sug1 protein was co-Ip'd with HA3TBP from crude extracts by the anti-HA monoclonal antibody. TBP is thought to function in vivo as part of the larger complex TFIID [39] and the result shown in Fig. 3 therefore presumably reflects a direct or indirect

Fig. 3. Sug1 protein co-immunoprecipiates with epitope-tagged TBP or TAFII90. Extracts made from cells that express triply HA-tagged TBP or TAFII90 were incubated with bead-bound anti-HA monoclonal antibody. Retained proteins were analyzed by SDS­PAGE and Western blotting with the appropriate antibodies. The control lane represents an immunoprecipitation in which an antibody raised against an epitope other than the HA tag was used. APIS­TFIID association. However, TBP is involved in transcription mediated by all three RNA polymerases, so it was of interest to repeat this experiment using an epitope-tagged polII-specific TBP-associated factor (TAFII). As shown in Fig. 3 (bottom), when immobilized anti-HA antibody was incubated with an extract made from cells that express HA3-TAFII90, Sug1 was again observed to co-immunoprecipitate. To probe for direct interactions in yet another way, the 19S complex was biotinylated and bound to streptavidin-coated Dynabeads. This 19S preparation was obtained from immunopurified 26S proteasome, which was devoid of detectable transcription factors [14]. These beads were then employed as bait to determine if the immobilized proteins could retain transcription factors from a crude extract. The results are shown in Fig. 4A. TBP and Tfb2 (TFIIH) were retained (Fig. 4A, second lane). A much lower level of TBP and only a trace of Tfb2 were observed to bind to control Dynabeads lacking bound 19S complex (fourth lane). As mentioned above, there are six ATPases in the 19S complex that are thought to unfold substrate proteins in proteasome-mediated proteolysis [7]. To determine if transcription factor-APIS associations are sensitive to ATP, immunopurified, biotinylated 19S complex immobilized on strepavidin-coated Dynabeads was incubated with yeast extract in the presence or absence of ATP (all of the experiments described above were conducted without adding ATP to the extract). As shown in Fig. 4A, binding of TBP and TFIIH (Tfb2) to

Fig. 4. Transcription factor­19S interactions are ATP-sensitive. (A) Immunopurified, biotinylated 19S complex immobilized on streptavidin-coated Dynabeads was incubated with the extract in the presence or absence of ATP. The retention of TBP and TFIIH was then addressed by SDS­PAGE and Western blotting with the appropriate antibodies. Much lower levels of binding, comparable to those of the control (beads lacking 19S), were observed in the presence of ATP. (B) 19S-dependent (see Fig. 2) retention of TBP and RNA polymerase II by bead-bound GST­Rad23Ubl was assessed in the presence and absence of ATP. Again, lower levels of transcription factors were retained in the presence of ATP. 19S binding (as assayed by Sug1 retention) to Rad23Ubl was unaffected by the nucleotide triphosphate.

the immobilized proteins was sensitive to the presence of ATP. In the presence of the nucleotide triphosphate, lower levels of these transcription factors were retained on the beads than when ATP was not added (compare the second and third lanes of Fig. 4A). A similar result was obtained when bead-bound GST­Rad23Ubl was incubated with crude whole cell extract (Fig. 4B). Again, lower levels of transcription factors (TBP and Rpb1 (polII)) were observed in the bead-bound fraction, although the difference was not as dramatic as that obtained using immobilized 19S. Note that the association between the ATPases and Rad23Ubl is not sensitive to ATP, as evidenced by the fact that the same amount of Sug1 was retained on the beads in the presence and absence of ATP (Fig. 4B). The data above show that Sug1, presumably in the context of the APIS complex, associates with general transcription factors. Is the 20S proteolytic core particle also part of this complex (or these complexes)? Proteins (20S) are readily detected in the GST­Rad23Ubl-bound fraction (Fig. 1), indicating that Ubl can associate with


996 L. Sun et al. / Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 296 (2002) 991­999

the intact 26S proteasome, as demonstrated by others [34]. Thus, it is possible that the intact proteasome is associated with transcription factors. Alternatively, the result shown in Fig. 1B could reflect the binding of at least two distinct Sug1-containing species to GST­Rad23Ubl, the 26S proteasome, and the APIS­TF complex. Some circumstantial evidence favors the latter model. For example, the fact that the level of transcription factors retained by GST­Rad23Ubl is substoichiometric with respect to 19S. In addition, when HA3-TBP is immunoprecipitated from a GST­Rad23Ubl-binding fraction, only about 10% of the Sug1 co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 3B). To distinguish between these possibilities more rigorously, the experiment shown schematically in Fig. 2A was repeated, but, in this case, antibodies raised against the ATPases and 20S proteins were employed to probe the TBP-associated fraction to determine if significant amounts of the core particle were co-immunoprecipitated with TFIID. As shown in Fig. 5A, while 20S proteins were readily detected in the Rad23Ubl-associated fraction (first lane), little or no 20S co-immunoprecipitated with TBP (second lane). As expected, significant amounts of Sug1 were associated with HA3TBP (second lane). To address this question in another way, a whole cell extract was made from a strain expressing an epitopetagged Pre1 protein, a sub-unit of the 20S proteasome. As shown in Fig. 5B, immunoprecipitation of the 20S complex results in the co-immunoprecipitation of Sug1, as expected. However, when the immunoprecipitated fraction was probed for TFs (in this case, Tfb2 and Med8), the levels of protein detected were not significantly above background. These data indicate that the Sug1 protein can associate with either the 20S core particle to form the 26S proteasome or with transcription factors, but that these binding events are mutually exclusive. The data described above demonstrate a physical association between general transcription factors and the 19S regulatory particle of the proteasome. To address whether this complex (or complexes) is functionally important for transcription, a depletion experiment was conducted in which a whole cell extract was passed over immobilized GST­Rad23Ubl or GST as a control. This protocol resulted in the depletion of approximately 75% of the Sug1 in the extract relative to the GST mock depletion (Fig. 6, top). Note that the figure displays the proteins left in the supernatant. As expected from the data presented above, some general transcription factors were also depleted from the extract by GST­Rad23Ubl (Fig 6, top). Equal amounts of total protein from the GST- and GSTRad23Ubl-depleted extracts were then added to an in vitro transcription reaction [37]. As seen in the bottom of Fig. 6, the GST­Rad23Ubl-depleted extract was significantly less active in an in vitro tran-

Fig. 5. The 20S proteasome core particle is not associated with the Sug1-transcription factor complex(es). (A) A ``double pull-down'' protocol identical to that presented in Fig. 2A was employed using an extract made from cells that express triply HA-tagged TBP. The eluate from the GST­Rad23Ubl column contained both 19S and 20S, as expected. However, when tagged TBP was immunoprecipitated from this fraction, only 19S (Sug1), but not the 20S, was observed to coimmunoprecipitate. (B) Immunoaffinity-purified 26S proteasome does not contain significant levels of transcription factors. An extract prepared from a strain that expresses FLAG-tagged Pre1 protein (a 20S component) was incubated with bead-bound anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody or a bead-bound control antibody. Sug1 (19S complex) was observed in the immunoprecipitate, but no detectable Med8p was present and the level of TFIIH present was identical to the background of the control experiment.

scription assay than the mock-depleted extract in the presence of the activator Pho4p [40] or in a reaction that was identical, except that the Pho4 activator was omitted (basal transcription). This experiment argues that the 19S-transcription factor complex (or complexes) bound by Rad23Ubl is functional in both basal and activated transcription. As another indication of the functional nature of the APIS­transcription factor complex, we examined whether the Pho4 protein was capable of interacting with Sug1 and general transcription factors. As shown in Fig. 7A, when a GST­Pho4 fusion protein was incubated with a crude yeast extract prepared from a strain expressing epitope-tagged Sug2, Western blot analysis revealed the retention of the APIS components Sug2, Cim5, and Sug1 as well as TBP and TFIIH. To determine if the Pho4-APIS interaction was direct, the former

Fig. 6. Depletion of the Sug1-containing complex from an extract inhibits transcription. A transcriptionally active extract was repeatedly passed over bead-bound GST­Rad23Ubl or, as a control, GST. Rad23Ubl depletion removed about 75% of the 19S complex (as monitored by Sug1 levels) relative to the control and also resulted in the loss of approximately 40% of the TBP and 30% of the TFIIH. Note that the Western blots at the top of the figure show the level of proteins remaining in the flowthrough from each column. The flow-through fractions were then tested for in vitro transcription activity either in the presence or absence of the activator Pho4. The same amount of total protein was employed in each case. The depleted extract was 3- to 5fold less active than the control extract in Pho4p-activated and basal (non-activated) transcription. More material from the basal reaction was added to the gel to achieve approximately equivalent band intensities in the activated and unactivated reactions to allow a direct comparison of the effect of Sug1 depletion in each reaction.

After thorough washing, the proteins in the pellet were analyzed by SDS­PAGE and Western blotting. (B) Immunopurified 19S complex [14] was incubated with GST­Pho4 or, as a control, GST­GFP. Retention of Sug1 protein was monitored by SDS­PAGE and Western blot analysis of the pelleted proteins.

was incubated with immunopurified 19S complex. Western blotting demonstrated that Pho4 retained the Sug1 protein in this case as well (Fig. 7B).

Discussion In this study, it has been demonstrated that the ATPases of the proteasome are present in one or more complexes that also include general transcription factors. Evidence for Sug1 association with Cdc68, polII(Rpb1), TFIID (TBP, TAFII90), TFIIH (Tfb2), and the mediator (Med8) was obtained from various pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. This work builds on and extends previous reports on proteasomal ATPasetranscription factor interactions [30,32]. Several lines of evidence argue against the trivial hypothesis that these associations merely reflect the fraction of transcription factors in the cell undergoing proteasome-mediated

proteolysis at any given time. First, most proteins processed by the proteasome are poly-ubiquitinated [41] but the molecular masses ofthe Sug1-associatedtranscription factors, as estimated by their migration in gels, are those expected of unmodified proteins. Second, Gal6p and cyclophilin, which are not transcription factors, were not observed to associate with Sug1. Third, GST­Rad23Ubl retains a complex (or complexes) that is functional for transcription in vitro (Fig. 6), which is at odds with the idea that the Sug1-associated transcription factors are in the process of being degraded at the time of extract preparation. Fourth, the 20S proteasome core particle is not observed in these Sug1-transcription factor complexes. Therefore, we propose that the physical associations between the APIS complex and general transcription factors reflect a biologically relevant interaction important for transcription. At this point, it is impossible to say whether the physical interactions observed in this study represent one or several distinct complexes. Current thinking in the field is that RNA polymerase, the mediator, TFIIF, and several other factors constitute the so-called RNA polymerase II holoenzyme [42,43]. However, the composition of this holoenzyme has been defined by the factors observed to associate stably over several chromatography columns [44­48] and the in vivo situation is unclear. One limiting model would be that the APIS

complex is part of a very large holoenzyme complex that includes most or all of the general transcription factors, the mediator and polII, which fragments during standard purification protocols. On the other hand, most of the data are equally consistent with two or more discreet assemblies that include the APIS complex and TFs. For example, it is has been proposed that, at least in yeast, TFIID is not part of the holoenzyme [43]. The proteasomal ATPases could associate independently with TFIID and holoenzyme. More work will be necessary to test these different models. Likewise, the distinct molecular connections that tether the APIS proteins to the transcription machinery are currently unclear. We note however that XPB, the mammalian analog of the Ssl2 component of yeast TFIIH, binds to recombinant murine Sug1 [49] and yeast TBP binds to in vitro transcribed and translated yeast Sug1 [31]. We have shown previously that the activity of the Sug1 protein is required for efficient RNA polymerase II elongation in a crude extract and in cells [14], whereas there appeared to be little effect in vitro on the pre-initiation complex (PIC) formation and the synthesis of short (<50 nucleotide transcripts). However, this does not rule out a role of the APIS complex in PIC formation, since the conditions employed in vitro may not reflect the in vivo situation. The association between TFIID and the the APIS complex observed in this study (Figs. 1­4, 6) suggests that APIS is part of the PIC, since TFIID is not generally considered an elongation factor. An interesting feature of the APIS­transcription factor interactions is that they are more labile in the presence of ATP (Fig. 4). We have found the same to be true for association of the APIS complex with the Gal4 activation domain (submitted). This suggests that under cellular conditions, the association is dynamic and that the APIS complex could shuttle between different protein partners, and thus, engage in transcription [14], repair [35], proteolysis [3], and perhaps other cellular processes.
