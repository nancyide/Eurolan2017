TheN-endrule relates the in vivo half-life ofa

protein to theidentityof itsN-terminal residue.In the yeast Saccharomyces cereuisiae, substrates of the Nendrulepathwayaretargetedfordegradation by a complexthatincludesthe 225-kDa N-recognin, encoded byUBRl,and the20-kDaubiquitin-conjugating enzyme encoded byUBC2.We report that bothphysical stabilityand functionalactivity of the N-recognin

The eukaryotic N-degron comprises at least two determinants: adestabilizing N-terminal residue and an internal Lys residue (or residues) (Bachmair andVarshavsky, 1989;Johnson et al., 1990;Dunten et al., 1991).The latter is the site of attachment of a multiubiquitin (multi-Ub) chain whose formation is required for the degradation of at least some N-end rule substrates. In a multi-Ub chain, several ubiquitin (Ub)'

Ubc2 complex require the presence of a highly acidic

23-residue region at the C terminusofUbc2.Ubc2C88A, aninactivevariant of Ubc2 in which theactivesiteCys-88has been replaced by Ala,isshown to retain the affinity for N-recognin. Expression of Ubc2-CSSA inhibits the N-endrulepathway, apparentlyasa result of competition between Ubc2 TJbc2-CSSAfor bindand ing to N-recognin. The two-hybrid (interaction cloning) techniquewas used toidentify a -170-residue Cterminal fragment of the1,950-residueN-recogninas

moieties areattached sequentially toan acceptor protein, forming a chainof Ub-Ub conjugates in which the C-terminal Gly-76of one Ub isjoined to Lys-48of the adjacent Ub (Chau et al., 1989; Johnson et al., 1992). A substrate that bears a multi-Ub chainis degraded by the 26 Sproteasome, a -1,500 kDa, ATP-dependent, multicatalytic protease that contains more than 20 distinct subunits.Different Ub-dependent pathways are mediated by distinct targeting complexes while apparently sharing at least a protease component (the 20 S or "core" proteasome) (reviewed by Finley and Chau, 1991;

aUbc2-interactingdomain.We also show that thelevel Rechsteiner, 1991;Hershko and Ciechanover, 1992; Goldberg,

of UBRl mRNA decreases upon overexpressionof UBC2. This effect of UBC2 is observed with cells 1992;Hochstrasser, 1992;Varshavsky, 1992). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae,the recognition com-

Among the functions of intracellular proteolysis are the elimination of abnormal proteins andthe temporal controlof many cellular processes that involve short-lived regulators. chemically modified protein structures thatconfer metabolic instabilityare called degradation signals, or degrons (Varshavsky, 1991). An essential component of one degradation signal is the protein's N-terminal residue (Bachmair et al., 1986).Thepresence of this signal,the N-degron,is manifested asthe N-end rule, which relates the in vivo half-life of a protein to theidentity of its N-terminal residue (reviewedby Varshavsky, 1992).Distinct versions of the N-end rule operate in all organisms examined, from mammals to yeast and bacteria (Bachmair et al., 1986;Gonda et al., 1989;Tobias et al., 1991). * This work wassupportedby GrantsAGO8991and GM31530from the National Institutes of Health (toA.

Amino acid sequences, conformational determinants,or

also known as E30 (Hershkoand Ciechanover, 1992)), is encoded by the UBRl gene (Bartel et al., 1990).The 225-kDa N-recognin (Ubrl) selects potential N-end rule substrates by binding totheir primary destabilizing N-terminal residues Phe, Leu, Trp, Tyr,Ile, Arg, Lys, and His. N-recognin has at least two substrate-binding sites. The type 1site is specific for the basic N-terminal residues Arg, Lys, and His. The type 2 site is specific for the bulky hydrophobic N-terminal residues Phe, Leu, Trp, Tyr, and Ile (Reiss et al., 1988;Gonda et al., 1989; Baker and Varshavsky, 1991). TheseN-terminal residues are bound directly by N-recognin, whereas secondary destabilizing N-terminal residues (Asp and Glu inyeast) function throughtheir conjugation, by Arg-tRNA-protein transferase (R-transferase),to Arg, one of the primary destabilizing residues. Tertiary destabilizing N-terminal residues, Asn and Gln, function through theirconversion, by a specific amidase, into the secondary destabilizing residues Asp and Glu (Gonda et al., 1989; Balzi et al., 1990; reviewed by Varshavsky, 1992). In S. cerevisiae,the ubiquitination of N-end rule substrates has been found to require the Ub-conjugatingenzymeencoded by the UBC2gene (its old name is RADG),and Ubc2 has been shown to be physically associated with N-recognin (Dohmen et al., 1991a).The yeast Ubc2 can also function as an N-end rule-mediatingUb-conjugating enzymein a heterologouscellfree system such as an extract from rabbit reticulocytes (Sung et d . , 1991). Ubc2is one of at least 10distinct Ub-conjugating The abbreviations used are: Ub, ubiquitin; Nt-amidase, N-terminal amidase; kb, kilobases or kilobasepairs; @gal,E. coli8-galactosidase; Ub-X-@gal,ubiquitin-X-@gal,where X is an amino acid residue at the Ub-@galjunction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; XGal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-@-~-galactopyranoside; ha, hemag-

Processesthat are known to be perturbed by mutationsin UBC2 include DNA repair,induced mutagenesis,cell cycle control,sporulation, regulationof retrotransposontransposition, and the N-end rulepathwayofproteindegradation (Reynolds et al., 1985; Borts et al., 1986;Friedberg, 1888 Picologlouet al., 1990; Maduraet al., 1990;Ellison et al., 1991; Kang et al., 1991; Dohmen et al., 1991a,andreferences therein).The N-end rule pathway is inactivein either a ubc2 or a ubrl null mutant; however,the overall ubc2phenotypeis moresevere than that of ubrl, indicating that the functions of the ubc2 enzymearenot confined to the N-end rule pathway (Dohmenet al., 1991a). While it is likelythat most of the E2 enzymes in yeast and other eukaryotes are guidedto their in vivo substratesby E2associated "recognition"subunits (recognins) (Varshavsky, 1992),the yeast N-recognin . ubc2 complex remainsthe only

in our earlier UBRI-expressing plasmids. QCR9, located next to UgRl on Chromosome VII, encodes subunit 9 of the mitochondrial ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase complex (Trumpower, 1990; Phillips andTrumpower, 1993).Cellscarrying UBRl-expressing,high copy plasmids that also expressed atruncated QCR9 hada mild petite-like phenotype (slow growth on inefficiently fermentable carbon sources such as raffinose or galactose, datanot shown). The -0.35-kb, Pcup,promoter-containing region of the plasmid pJDC222 (see below) was excised by Sat1 and Sad, and ligated into SalI/ SacI-cut pKM1307, yieldingpKM1315, which expressed UBRl from the Pcuplpromoter. (pJDC22-2 was constructed by a multistep protocol (details available upon request) that included the insertion of a YEp46 (Ecker et al., 1987) (a gift from D. Finley, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) into the BamHI-cut polylinker ofYCplac22 (Gietz and Sugino, 1988).) The plasmid pKM1315 was treated with SpeIand Klenow PoII,and self-ligated,producing a 4-baseinsertion/ frameshift mutationat thenucleotide position 510 in the UBRZ open reading frame (Bartel et al., 1990).The resulting plasmid, pKM1320, expressed a 170-residue N-terminal fragment of the 1,950-residue Ubrl protein (the mutationproduced a stopcodon immediately after the nucleotide position 510). Neither pKM1315 nor pKM1320inhibited cell growth under conditions that induced their UBR1-linked Pcupl promoter (0.1mM CUSOI,see Fig. 4).

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Strains, Media, Genetic Techniques, and @-GalactosidaseAssayThe S. cereuisiae strains used in this work are listed in Table I. 5'. cereuisiueweregrown at 30 "C in rich (YPD) orsynthetic media (Sherman etal., 1986),with the lattercontaining either 2% dextrose (SDmedium),3% galactose (SGmedium), or 3% raffinose (SR medium). Transformation of S. cereuisiae was carried out by the methods of Dohmen et al.(1991b) or Schiestl and Gietz (1989). Enzymatic activity of @galin extracts from yeast cultures in exponential growth (Am < 1)was measured using the o-nitrophenyl-0-Dgalactoside assay as described by Baker and Varshavsky (1991). Plasmid Construction-Standard methods were used (Ausubel et al., 1989). DNA fragments were isolated from agarose gels using Geneclean (BiolOl,La Jolla, CA).The high copy (2p-based) plasmid pADHUBC2 which expressed Ubc2 from the strong P ~promoter H ~ was constructed using the vector YEplacl95 as described in Dohmen et al. (1991a).The analogous plasmids pJD647, pJD617, pJD616, and pJD615 that expressed, respectively, Ubc2-C88A,Ubc2-164,Ubc2153, and Ubc2-149 from the P ~ promoter H ~ were constructed by inserting thesemutant allelesof UBC2,contained inEcoRI fragments from plasmids pR647 (Sung et al., 1990),pR617, pR616, and pR615 (Morrison et al., 1988)(gifts from L. Prakash, University of Rochester, NY), into EcoRI-cut YEplacl95ADH (Dohmen et al., 1991a). The plasmid pKM1167 that expressed UBC2 from the galactoseinducible Pealpromoter was constructed by first isolating a -0.6-kb BamHI-EcoRI fragment of pG12 (Nicolet and Friedberg, 1987)that contained the P G ~ ~ ~promoter ~ ~ , G A Lregion, blunting the fragment's ends with Klenow PolI, and ligating the fragment into the SmaI-cut, low copy (CEN-based) plasmid YCplac33 (Gietz and Sugino, 1988), yieldingpKM1035. A -0.6-kb fragment of pDG309-containing UBC2 (a gift from R. D. Gietz, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada) was then ligated into EcoRI-cut pKM1035, yielding pKM1167. The ubc2-148 allele of UBC2, used in UBC2-UBRl coexpression experiments (Fig. 4), was constructed from UBC2 using polymerase chain reaction and synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (Ausubel et al., 1989). The polymerase chain reaction-produced fragment containing ubc2148was ligated into EcoRI-cut pKM1035, yieldingpKM1166. To express UBRl from the copper-inducible Pcuplpromoter, we modified the highcopy plasmid pJD1003, a derivative of pSOB35 that encoded Ubrl and containeda unique Sal1 site (produced by site-directed mutagenesis) 15base pairs upstreamof the start(ATG) codon ofUBRZ? This plasmid was digested with PstI and EspI, treated with T4DNApolymerase, andself-ligated,yieldingpKM1307, which lacks a 5'-proximal portion of the QCR9gene that was present R. J. Dohmen, B.

and tryptophan. A 15-ml sample of each culture was centrifuged to pellet the cells,which were then washed with 1ml ofwater. Galactose was added to the remainder of the cultures to a final concentration of 3%. Samples were withdrawn from the cultures 1,2, and3 h after the addition of galactose. Washed cell pellets were resuspended in 0.25 mlof ice-coldTEN buffer (0.5 M NaC1, 10mM Na-EDTA,0.2 M Tris-HC1, pH 7.5).An equal volume of glass beads and 0.25 ml of phenol-chloroform (l:l, equilibrated at pH 8) were added, followed by vortexing at maximum speed for 2 min, with intermittent cooling on ice (Silverman, 1987).The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 X g for 1min, and theaqueousphase was reextracted twicewithphenolchloroform, followedby the addition of 2 volumesof 95%ethanol and incubation at -20 "C to precipitate nucleic acids, whichwere recovered by centrifugation at 12,000x g for 5 min. The nucleic acid pellets were dissolvedin 2mM dithiothreitol containing500 units/ml of RNAsin (Promega)The concentration of RNA was determined by measuring A2w (these preparations contained negligible amounts of DNA, data notshown). ForNorthern hybridization, a slightly modified procedure of McMaster and Carmichael (1977)was used. 25 pgof total RNA was treated with 1.5M deionized glyoxal, 50% dimethyl sulfoxide,10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, at 50 "C for 1h, cooled, and electrophoresed at 4 V/cm, with recirculation of electrophoretic buffer, in an 0.8% agarose gel containing 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5. The gel was incubated in 25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, for 15 min, and the RNA was transferred by blotting in the same buffer to a Genescreen membrane (DuPont). Thegel wasstained with ethidium bromide and photographed at 300 nmbefore and after the transfer to verify equimolarity of RNA sample loads andthe uniformity of transfer. The membrane was heated at 85 "Cfor 3 h, placed in 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, sealed in a plastic bag, and prehybridized for 30 min at 65'C. 32PLabeled DNA probes were prepared by the method of Feinberg and Vogelstein (1984),using 0.1 pgof gel-purified DNA fragments. The heat-denatured DNA probes were added to theplastic bag and incubated with the membrane-immobilizedRNA for -15 h at 65 "C.The membrane was then washed twice for 30 min at 65 T in 0.2% SDS, 0.3 M NaC1, 30 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0. The UBRZ-specificprobe was a -5.3-kb SpeI-KpnI fragment of pSOB44 (Bartel et al., 1990)that is contained within the UBRl open reading frame. The UBCZ-specific probe was a -0.6-kb EcoRI fragment of pDG309 (see above) that included the entire 516-basepair open reading frame of UBC2. The probes were labeled with 32Pand mixed together before hybridization. After completion of the Northern analysis, a control hybridization was carried out with the same membrane (without removing the hybridized UBRl and UBC2 probes), using a 32P-labeledACT1 (yeast actin gene) probe (a -2-kb BamHI-PstI fragment of pTB392; a gift of J. Jones, McArdle Laboratory, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). Hybridization patterns were detected either by standard autoradiography with x-ray

films or using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) (Johnston et al., 1990; Tobias et al., 1991) and quantified as described in the legend to Fig. 40. CoimmunoprecipitationAssay-Cells from 20-ml exponential yeast cultures (Am < 1) of thestrain BBY68 (ubc2A ubrlA, Table I) transformed with various plasmids (see "Results")were collected by centrifugation at 2,500 X g for 5 min, resuspended in 0.5 ml of SD medium lacking methionine, and labeled with 0.2 mCi of [%]Translabel ( E N ) for 30 rnin at 30 "C. The labeled cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.5 ml of DB buffer (50 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na-EDTA, 50 mM Na-HEPES,pH 7.5) containingprotease inhibitors leupeptin, pepstatin A, antipain, chymostatin, and aprotinin (each at 20 pg/ml, Sigma), and lysedby vortexing with glass beads (Bartel et al., 1990).The extracts were centrifuged at 12,000x g for 10 min. Immunoprecipitation assays were carried out with the supernatants by adding ascitic fluid (1p1/0.3 ml of a supernatant) containingthe anti-hamonoclonal antibody 12CA5(Fieldet al., 1988) (BabcoInc., Richmond, CA) to thesingle or mixed extracts described under "Results"and in the legendtoFig. 2. Allsamplesalso contained a -10-fold excess of an identically prepared yeast extract from untransformed, unlabeled BBY68 (ubc2A ubrlA) cells. The samples were incubated on ice for 2 h;20 pl of Protein A-Sepharose (Repligen, Cambridge,MA) wasthen added, and thesuspensionswereincubated, with end-over-end rotation, for 1h at 4 "C,followed bya 5-8centrifugation in amicrocentrifuge. Pellets were washed four times with 0.8 mlof DB buffer containing 5%glycerol, resuspended in electrophoretic sample buffer, heated at 100"Cfor 3 min, and subjectedto SDSPAGE (13%), followedby fluorography. `%-Labeled SDS-PAGE cerevisiae UBC2 gene containing an EcoRI site immediately 5' to its start (ATG) codon (a gift from R.D. Gietz) was isolated as a 525base pair EcoRI-SalI fragment and ligated into EcoRIISalI-cut pMA424 (Ma and Ptashne,1987),yielding the plasmid pKM1210-1, which expressed a fusion containing the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 upstream of the complete sequence ofUbc2. The S. cereuisiae strain GGY1::171 (Gilland Ptashne,1987)wastransformed (Schiestl and Gietz, 1989)with pKM12lO-1. His+transformantswere selected on DOBA-his plates (BIOlOl), yielding KMY528 (Table I). This strain was transformed with DNA pools from thethree libraries pGAD1,2, and 3, in which yeast genomic DNAfragments (produced by apartial Sau3A digestion) had been fused, in three different frames, to anupstream fragment that encoded the activation domain of Gal4 (Chien et al., 1991;a giftfrom P. Bartel, SUNY, StonyBrook, NY).Transformantswereselectedon DOBA-his-leuplates (BIOlOl), and -1.5 X lo6colonies were replica-plated onto the same medium containing the chromogenic 8-galactosidase substrate XGal (Chien et al., 1991). This screen yielded 14blue transformants thatremained blue upon restreaking. The HZS3-basedpKM1210-1was evicted from these transformants by growingthem on histidine-containingmedium. The library-derived plasmids were isolated from the resulting His- transformants as described by Hoffman and Winston (1987) and transformedinto theEscherichia coli strainDH5a Theamplifiedplasmids were purified from E. coli and transformed into KMY528 (Table I), confirming the results of the initial XGal screen. Nucleotide sequencing, using the chain terminationmethod (Ausubelet al., 1989),of the yeast DNA insertsin the plasmids showed that all but one insert encoded Ga14. This insert was found to encode a -170-residue Cterminal fragment of the 1,950-residue Ubrl protein (plasmid pKM1312, the exact number of Ubrl residues encoded by the pKM1312 insert is not given because the corresponding sequencing gelwas unreadable close tothe sequencing primer site; data not shown). In a negative control, pKM1312 was transformed into the GGY1::171 strain carrying pEE5, a plasmid that expressed a fusion of the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 to Snfl, a protein presumably unrelated to Ubc2 (Yang et al., 1992).As expected, these transformants yielded white colonieson XGal plates. RESULTS TheAcidic C-terminal Region of Ubc2 Is Required forDegradation ofN-end Rule Substrates-Degradation of proteins by the N-end rule pathway was assayed in vivo using derivatives of E. coli @-galactosidase(@gal)as model substrates.

specific processing proteases to yield X-@galtestproteins bearing the desired residue X at the N-terminus (Bachmair et al., 1986;Gonda et al., 1989).In contrast to thefunction of Ub in proteindegradation, the role of Ub in these engineered Ub fusions is to allow the in uiuo generation of otherwise identical proteins bearing different N-terminal residues. Depending on the identity of X, the X-@galproteins are either long-lived or metabolically unstable, with destabilizing Nterminal residues conferring short half-lives on the correspondingX-@gals(Bachmair et al., 1986;Tobias et al,, 1991). This N-terminal degradation signal (the N-degron) is manifested as theN-end rule. Previous work (Dohmen et ai., 1991a) has shown that the normally short-lived N-end rule substrates such as Arg-@gal are long-livedin S. cereuisiae strains lacking the UBC2 gene. One feature of the 172-residueUbc2 Ub-conjugating enzyme is its highly acidic 23-residue C-terminal regionwhich contains 20 acidic residues (Aspor Glu) (Fig. lA,Reynolds et al., 1985). The acidic "tail" of Ubc2 is required for some but apparently not for all of the Ubc2 functions. In particular, strains whose mutant Ubc2 protein lacks the acidic tail are unable to sporulate (as homozygous ubc2 diploids), but they are nearly wild-type in their ability to carry out DNA repair and induced mutagenesis, in marked contrastto congenic ubc2A strains (Morrison et al., 1988). Given this earlier evidence, we asked whether tailless variants of Ubc2are active in theN-end rule pathway. Otherwise identical plasmids expressing either the wild-type Ubc2 or its Cterminally truncatedderivatives (Fig.1A)weretransformed into a ubc2A yeast strain thatexpressed either Arg-Bgal (Ub-

Metabolicstabilities of Arg-(?galand Met-(?galwere compared by determining their intracellular concentrations (Fig. 1B). Previous work (Bartel et al., 1990;Balzi et al., 1990; Baker and Varshavsky, 1991;Dohmen et al., 1991a)has shown that the steady state level of an X-(?galprotein in yeast cells is a sensitive indicator of its metabolic stability; compare, for example, the levels of Met-@gal(till > 20 h)and Arg-(?gal tical vectors in cells that also expressed the wild-type UBC2 gene (Fig. lB, Ubc2-172).However, in the congenic ubc2A cells, the level of Arg-Bgal was much higher, close to that of

As can be seen from the datain Fig. lB, theshortening of the 23-residveacidictail of Ubc2 by8residues (yieldingUbc2164)did not impair the ability of Ubc2 to support the degradation of Arg-(?gal,whereas the Ubc2-153 derivative which lacked all but 4 residues of the acidic tail was severely impaired in this function (Fig. lB, Ubc2-164 versus Ubc2-153). The residual activity of Ubc2-153 in the N-end rule pathway could be eliminated by deleting the 4 remaining residues of the acidic tail (Fig. lB, Ubc2-149 versus Ubc2-153). The level of the normally short-lived Arg-(?gal in cells expressing the entirely taillessUbc2-149 was indistinguishable from the level of the normally long-lived Met-(?gal(Fig. lB, Ubc2-149). In contrast, the level of Arg-Bgal was significantly(and reproducibly) lower thanthat of Met-(?gal in ubc2A cells (Fig. lB, Ubc2A). Cells lacking Ubc2 are known to contain elevated levels of other Ub-conjugating (E2) enzymes, in particular Ubc4 (data not shown). This apparently "reciprocal" cross-regulation among E2 enzymes suggests the following explanation for a paradoxically higher residual activity of the N-end rule pathway in the total absence of Ubc2 than in the presence of the tailless Ubc2.First, it is assumed that atleast some of the E2 enzymes other thanUbc2 have a weak but significant affinity for the UBRl-encoded N-recognin. Second, it is assumed that expression of either the wildtype Ubc2 or its tailless derivative such as Ubc2-149 downregulates the expression of the postulated "cross-complementing" E2enzymes.This model couldaccount forthe above results (Fig. lB, Ubc2-149 versus UbcPA), because a (hypothetical) cross-complementing E2 enzyme would be induced in a ubc2A strain but not in a ubc2-149 strain. Examples of at least partial functionalcomplementation between different E2 enzymes in yeast have been reported previously. For instance, overexpression of the yeast UBC5 gene partially complementsproteolytic defectsof the h 4 A mutant (Seufert and Jentsch,1990). TheAcidic C-terminal Region of Ubc2Is Requiredfor High Affinity Binding of Ubc2to N-recognin-Earlier coimmunoprecipitation experiments have shown thatthe UBRl-encodedN-recognin isphysicallyassociated with Ubc2 (Dohmen et al., 1991a).We asked whether a Ubrl.Ubc2 complex that is stable enough to be detectable in a coimmunoprecipitation assay requires the presence of the acidic C-terminal region in Ubc2. A modifiedUbrl protein used in these experiments had its C-terminus extended with a 9-residue sequence derived from hemagglutinin (ha)of influenza virus and containingan epitope (the ha tag) recognizableby the monoclonal antibody 12CA5(Bartelet al., 1990;Dohmen etal., 1991a).Theepitopetagged Ubrl (Ubrl-ha) was functionally active, in that the UBRl-hagene and theunmodified UBRl gene wereindistinguishable in their ability to complement the ubrlA mutant

The antibody precipitated the Ubrl-ha protein from all samples that contained Ubrl-ha (Fig.2A, lanes b, d,f, h,j , and 1). Crucially, the antibody did notprecipitateproteins the size of Ubc2(19.7 kDa)or its derivatives from samples containing Ubc2 but lacking Ubrlha (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes c, e, g, i, and k). However, immunoprecipitation from the sample containing bothUbrl-ha and the wild-type Ubc2 protein yielded not only Ubrl-ha butalso a protein the size of Ubc2 (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes d; compare with lane c), confirming the earlier finding that thewild-type Ubc2 is physically associated with Ubrl (Dohmen et al., 1991a). Similar assays with Ubrl-ha and the C-terminally truncated Ubc2 derivative Ubc2-164, which lacks a portionof the acidic tail but is fully active in the N-end rule pathway (Fig. lB, Ubc2-164), also resulted in the coimmunoprecipitation of Ubc2-164 and Ubrl-ha(Fig. 2, A and B,lane h;compare with lane g). The same experiment was carried out with more extensivelytruncated Ubc2 derivatives, Ubc2-153 and Ubc2149.The former lacks all but 4residues of the acidic tail and is nearly inactive in the N-end rule pathway, while Ubc2-149 lacks the entire acidic tail and has no detectable activity in the pathway (Fig. lB, Ubc2-153 and Ubc2-149). Neither Ubc2-153 nor Ubc2-149 were coimmunoprecipitated with Ubrl-ha, in contrast to either the wild-type Ubc2 or Ubc2164 (Fig.2, A and B, lanesj and I; compare with, for instance, lane h).

residues is sufficient for both ahigh affinity (coimmunnoprecipitation assay-detectable) binding of Ubc2 to Ubrl andfor the function of Ubc2 in the N-end rule pathway. Regions of the Ubc2 enzyme otherthanthe acidic tail may also be involved in functionally relevant interactions with N-recognin, orin other N-end rule-relatedfunctions, because neither the Ubc3 (Silver etal., 1992; Kolman etal., 1992) nor the Ubc4 Ub-conjugating enzyme that have been modified bythe addition of the Ubc2-specificacidictail couldcomplement the N-end rule defect of a ubc2A train.^ N-recognin Is Bound to a -22-kDa Protein-The anti-ha antibody precipitated not only the -226-kDa Ubrl-ha and the -20-kDa UbcP (see above), but also aprotein with an apparent molecular mass of-22 kDa, termed p22(Fig.2B,

terminal ha tags: Immunoprecipitation from an extract containing Ubrl-ha-hashould have resulted in a detectable (-1.5 kDa) increase in the size of the p22 protein if it were a Cterminal (ha-bearing) fragment of Ubrl-ha-ha. No such increase was observed (data notshown), suggestingthat p22 is a distinct Ubrl-associated protein. A Dominant NegativeAllele of UBC2-Cys-88, the only Cys residue in the Ubc2 Ub-conjugating enzyme, has been shown to be the site of Ub thioester formation;replacement of Cys88 in Ubc2 with either Ala or Val eliminates the Ub-conjugating activity of Ubc2 andrendersit biologically inactive (Sung et al., 1990). As could be expected from these earlier findings, the Ubc2-C88A (Cys-Ala) derivative was found to

lanes b, d, f, h, j, and 1). The presence of p22 in an anti-ha be inactive in theN-end rule pathway (Fig. lB, Ubc2-C88A).

immunoprecipitate required the presence of Ubrl-ha in the initial extract but did not depend on the presence of Ubc2 (data not shown and Fig.2B, lanes b and d; compare with lanes a and c). Thus, the apparentassociation of p22 with Nrecognin does not require an intact N-recognin . Ubc2 complex. The possibility that p22 is aC-terminal proteolytic fragment of Ubrl-ha that bears the ha tag and is therefore immunoprecipitable with the anti-haantibody was tested by constructinga Ubrl variant that bore two consecutive CR. J. Dohmen, K. Madura, and A. Varshavsky, unpublished data (aplasmid expressinga derivative of Ubc3that bore the Ubc2-specific acidic tail was kindly provided by M. Ellison, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada). However, in contrast to theeffect of overexpressingthe tailless Ubc2-149 (whichdoes not bind toN-recognin and is also inactive in the N-end rule pathway; seeabove),overexpression of Ubc2-C88A in wild-type (UBC2) cells resulted in strong inhibition of the N-end rule pathway (Fig. 3). No such inhibition was observed upon overexpression of the wild-type UBC2 (Fig. 3). A likely reason for the difference between the effects of overexpressing Ubc2-149 and Ubc2-C88A is indicated by the finding that Ubc2-C88A, unlike Ubc2-149, retains theability of the wild-type Ubc2 to form a high affinity complex with the UBRl-encoded N-recognin (Fig. 2, A and B, lune f ; compare with lane 1).

N-recogninlUbc2 Interactions

Thus, ubcZ-C88A is a dominantnegative allele ofthe UBC2 gene, whoseinterferencewith the N-end rule pathway is likely to result from competition between the wild-type Ubc2 and Ubc2-C88A for binding to N-recognin. Although the Ubc2 regions in contactwith N-recognin are unlikely to be confined to the acidic tail of Ubc2 (see above), the overall affinity of "non-tail"Ubc2 regions for N-recognin is at most low: Ubc2149 isnot coimmunoprecipitated with N-recognin (Fig. 2), and theinhibition of the N-endrule pathway by Ubc2-149 is much weaker thanthe inhibition by Ubc2-C88A (Fig. 3, compare Ubc2-149 with UbcZ-C88A). Ubc2-C88A, whichlacks the thioester-forming Cys residue of the wild-type Ubc2, cannot accept Ub from the Ub-activating (El)enzyme (Sung et al., 1990).The apparently undiminished affinity of Ubc2-C88Afor N-recognin (see above) suggests that interactions between N-recognin and Ubc2 do not involve the thioester-bound Ub moiety of the wild-type Ubc2 (at the in vivo concentrations of Ub, Ubc2, and the UBAl-encodedEl enzyme,the bulk of Ubc2 is likely to bear

the thioester-bound Ub moiety (Pickart, 1988)). Ubc2-interacting Domain of N-recognin-To

encompasses approximately 10%of this 1,950-residueprotein contains a Ubc2-interactingdomain. Regulatory Interactions between UBCZ and UBRI-In the course of earlier experiments (Dohmen et al., 1991a), it was noticed that Ubrl and Ubc2 could not be overproduced simultaneously within the same yeast cells. It was subsequently found that the levels of UBRl mRNA (expressed from the the absence ofUBCZ expression (in ubc2A cells) but much lower ifcellscarried a high copyplasmid overexpressingUBC2 from the PADHI promoter. In addition, the copy number of a UBRl-expressingplasmid was decreased in thepresence of a plasmid expressing UBCZ butnotinthe presence of an otherwise identical plasmid lacking UBC2, suggesting that simultaneous overexpression of UBRl and UBC2 is cytotoxic.' To verify and analyze this effect, we constructeda high copyplasmid that expressed UBRl from the copper-inducible Pcuplpromoter, as well as a lowcopy (CEN-based) plasmid that expressed UBCZ from the galactose-induciblePGAL~ promoter. Both plasmids were transformed intothe ubrl A ubc2A strainKMY618,yielding the strainKMY633 (Table I),which waspropagated in the raffinose-containing SR medium in the absence of added copper ions, conditions which do not induce moter by galactose in cells that have been growing in the presence of raffinose is much faster than in cells that have been growing in the presence of dextrose (Griggs and Johnston, 1991;Johnston, 1987).) The strain KMY633 was grown in SR medium containing 0.1 mM CuS04(conditions that induce PCUpl-UBRl but not PGALI-UBCZ)to a midexponential phase (Asoo5 l), followed by the addition of galactose to a final concentration of 3% (conditions that induce PGALl-UBCSas well). RNA was isolated from cells either immediately before or (at hourly intervals) after the addition of galactose, followedby Northern analysis with UBRl and UBCZ hybridization probes (Fig. 4). While no expression of UBC2 was detectable in SR medium, UBC2 mRNA accumulated to a high levelwithin 1h afterthe addition of galactose (Fig.4A, UBC2; compare lanes a andb). Conversely,the level of UBRl mRNA washigh in SR medium but decreased by approximately 2.5-fold within 1h after the addition of galactose, and remained low afterward (Fig. 4A, UBRI; compare lanes a and b-d; see also Fig. 40). Therapid decrease of UBRl mRNA level upon induction ofUBC2 is likely to be caused by metabolic destabilization of UBRl mRNA, inasmuch as both UBCZ and UBRl were expressed from heterologous promoters thatare active in a coppersupplemented, galactose-containing medium.

domains of N-recognin that interact with the Ubc2 Ub-conjugating enzyme in vivo, we have used the "two-hybrid" interaction cloning technique of Fields and Song (1989). In this method, the expression of the E. coli lac2 reporter gene from signed to require the reconstitution of Gal4 activity from two unlinked but interactingprotein domains. Specifically, the DNA-binding domain of the Gal4protein isexpressedinyeast as a fusion whose C-terminalportion is a polypeptide of interest. These cells are transformed with a library in which quasi-randomly generated DNA fragments (from yeast or other species) are fused to a fragment that encodes the Gal4 transcription activation domain. Transformants expressing a polypeptide from the library that has asignificant affinity to the polypeptide of interestcan be identified asthose that induce their resident PGALl-hZ reporter gene because the DNA-binding andactivationdomains of Gal4 arebrought into spatialproximity through the interaction of polypeptides fused to each domain (Fields and Song, 1989; Chien et al., 1991;Chevray and Nathans, 1992;Yang et al., 1992). The S. cerevisiaestrain GGY1::171, which lacks both GAL4 and GAD0 genes and contains an integrated PGALl-lacZ reporter construct (Chien et al., 1991), was transformed with the plasmid pKM1210-1 which expressed the Gal4 DNAbinding domain fused to the N-terminus of the full-length Ubc2. The resulting strain, KMY528, was transformed with PGAD-based DNA libraries that expressed the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 fused (in all three frames) to partial Sau3A fragments of the yeast genomic DNA (Chien et al., 1991;see "Experimental Procedures"). 14 lacZ-expressing transformants were identified among -1.5 X lo6 colonies screened. While most of the pGAD plasmids from the positive transformants carried the intact GAL4 gene (the pGAD libraries were derived from a GAIA yeaststrain), one transformant was found to express a -170-residue C-terminal fragment of N-recognin (Ubrl) fused to theGal4 activation domain. The corresponding pGAD-based plasmid, termed pKM131.2, reproduciblyactivatedthe expression of the PGALl-hZreporter geneupon retransformation of the KMY528strain (GGY::171 carrying pKM1210-1). Inacontrolexperiment(datanot shown), the same plasmid did not activate the expression of P G A Lin-GGY1::171 carrying the plasmid pEE5, which I ~ ~ expressed the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 fused to a region of a presumably unrelated protein Snfl (Yang et al., 1992). We conclude that aC-terminal region of N-recognin that

the GAIA-dependent PGALl promoterin S. cerevisiae is de-

shown).) Moreover, since the doubling time of the KMY633 cells in this medium is approximately 3 h at 30 "C (data not shown), the rapidity of the observed decrease in the level of UBRl mRNA (Fig. 4, A and D) is unlikely to result from dilution of this mRNA due to cellular growth. A UBCZinduceddestabilization of UBRl mRNA remainstobeverified directly. The inhibitory effect of UBC2 expression on the levelof UBRl mRNA was found to require the region that encodes the acidic C-terminaltail ofUbc2 (Fig. 1A): no significant decrease inthe level of UBRl mRNAwas observed upon induction ofubc2-148 which encoded a tailless Ubc2 (Fig. 4, B and D).

strongly suggestingthat a functionally active Ubrl protein is required for down-regulation of UBRl mRNA by UBC2. A likely explanation of these findings (Fig. 4) is that the N-recognin . Ubc2 complex participates in the regulation of the UBRl-encoded N-recognin. For reasonsconsidered above this regulation appears to involve an enhanced degradation of UBRl mRNA upon an increase in UBC2 expression. DISCUSSION Our previous work has shown that theyeast N-recognin is physically associated with Ubc2, one of at least 10 Ub-conjugating enzymes in S. cereuisiae and an essential component of the yeast N-end rule pathway (Dohmen et al., 1991a). Further analysis resulted in thefollowingmain findings. (i)Both physical stability and functional activity of the Nrecognin . Ubc2 complexrequire the presence of a 23-residue C-terminal region in Ubc2 that contains 20 acidic residues (Aspor Glu). (ii) A Ubc2-interacting domain of the UBRl-encoded Nrecognin is located within the 170-residueC-terminal region of the 1,950-residue N-recognin. Whetherthis is the only Ubc2-interacting region of N-recognin and whether this region interacts with the C-terminal acidic region of Ubc2 remains to be determined. (iii)The ubc2-CB8A gene, in which the codon encoding the active-site Cys of Ubc2 has been replaced by an Ala codon, acts as a dominant negative allele of UBC2, most likely as a result of competition between the wild-type Ubc2 andits enzymatically inactive variant for binding to N-recognin. (iv) Expression ofUBC2 decreases the level of UBRl mRNA which encodes N-recognin. This effect requires the intact N-recognin-Ubc2 complex and is likely to result from enhanced degradation of UBRl mRNA upon an increase in UBC2 expression. (Reynolds et al.,1985; Jentsch et al.,1987; Dohmen et al., 1991a),and the Ub-activating (El)enzyme, encoded by the UBAl gene (McGrath et al., 1991). Inaddition to direct (immunoprecipitation-based) evidence for the physical association between N-recognin and Ubc2 (see "Results"), there is also circumstantial (overexpression-based)evidencefor the existence of aternary complex between N-recognin, ArgtRNA-protein transferase,and Nt-amidase` (these lattercomponents of the pathway modify N-termini of certain N-end rule substrates prior totheir binding by N-recognin; see Introduction). Proteins that participate in a complex metabolic transformation are often physically associated. The examples of a multienzyme assembly range from pyruvate dehydrogenase (synthesis of acetyl-coA) to replisome (DNA replication), spliceosome (RNA splicing), ribosome (proteinsynthesis), and proteasome complexes (protein degradation). Mechanistic advantages of such assemblies stem from their increased fidelity dueto often present editing capabilities, and alsofrom the properties of processivity and channeling that are central to the functioning of multienzyme machines. For example, the association between N-recognin and the Ubc2 Ub-conjugating enzyme not only endows the latter with the ability to recognize a substrate that bears a destabilizing N-terminal residue but may also contribute to processivity of the Ubc2mediated synthesis of a substrate-linked multi-Ub chain. The targeting complexof the S.cereuisiaeN-end rule pathway is likely to contain at least five components, Ntal, Atel, Ubrl, andUbc2 (whosesubunit molecularmasses are, respectively, 52,58,225, and 20 kDa), and also the at least transiently associated 114-kDaUbal (El)enzyme,which must be bound to Ubc2 during the E1+E2 transfer of an activated Ub moiety. That this list is incomplete is suggested by the R. Baker and A. Varshavsky,manuscriptin preparation.

cereuisiae Ubc2 enzyme are present in all eukaryotes examined, from yeasts to mammals. However, while a slightly shorter counterpart of the acidic C-terminal tail of the S. cereuisiae Ubc2 is alsopresentin Ubc2 from the related budding yeast Kluyueromyces l~ctisthis , ~ region isabsentfrom the otherwise close homologs of Ubc2 such as theRhp6 Ubconjugating enzyme of the fission yeast Schizosacchuromyces pombe (Reynoldset al.,1990),and from theDrosophila, rabbit, and human homologs ofUbcP as well (Koken et al., 1991a; Wing et al.,1992;Schneider et al.,1990;Koken et al., 1991b). In S. cereuisiae, the tailless derivative of Ubc2 is inactive in sporulation and in the N-end rule pathway but is able to support otherUbc2 functions suchas DNA repair and induced mutagenesis at nearly wild-type levels (see "Results" and Morrison et al.,1988).The sporulation defect in cells containing exclusively the tailless UbcP is unrelated to their lack of the N-recognin-Ubc2 complexbecause S. cereuisiaeis capable of sporulation in the absence of N-recognin and hence in the absence of the N-end rule pathway (Bartelet al., 1990).Thus, it is likely that theacidic tail of Ubc2 is also required for an interaction with an unknown Ubc2-specific recognin whose function is essential for sporulation in S. cereuisiae. The naturallytailless Ubc2 homologRhp6 of S.pombe was shown to complement the known phenotypes of ubc2A S. cereuisiae except for its defect in sporulation (complementation of the N-end rule defect has notbeen tested) (Reynolds et al., 1990). Conversely, the tailless derivative of the S. cereuisiae Ubc2 enzyme could complement all of the tested defects of an rhp6A S.pombe mutant, including its sporulation defect (Reynolds et al.,1990).Either thewild-type or tailless Ubc2 of S. cereuisiaecould function as anN-end rule-mediating enzyme in an extractfrom rabbit reticulocytes (Sunget al., 1992). The tailless Ubc2 might have preceded its acidic tail-containingvariantin a lineage of organisms that yielded S. cereuisiae and R lactis. In this model, N-recognin and UbcP of the S. cereuisiae lineage (but not the homologous protein pairs in predecessors of fission yeast and larger eukaryotes) coevolvedin a waythat resulted in apositively charged surface of a domain in N-recognin accommodating the multiple Asp and Glu residues of the acidic tail in Ubc2. Throughout this coevolution, UbcPwouldbe expected to retain its affinities for other recognins (which mediate other functionsof Ubc2) in ways that did not depend on the presence of an acidic tail in Ubc2. However, the converse interpretation, in which a tail-bearing Ubc2 and a correspondingly adapted N-recognin isthe ancestralconfiguration, is alsoplausible, in partbecause nothing is known about the natureof selective pressures that could underlie atail-related coevolution of Ubc2 and Nrecognin in some but notin all species. Regulatory Interactions in the N-end Rule Pathway-The intact N-recognin Ubc2 complex was shown to be required

for an observed decrease in the level of UBRI mRNA (which encodes N-recognin) upon an increase in UBC2 expression. A variety of evidence suggests that a decrease in the level of UBRl mRNAis brought aboutby a UBC2-mediateddecrease in its metabolic stability (see "Results").It remains to be seen whether this new effect of Ubc2 is mediated by the presently known function of the N-recognin Ubc2 complex, i.e.by an N-end rule-mediated degradation of a short-lived proteinthat directly or indirectly stabilizes UBRl mRNA, or whether a proteolysis-independent mechanismis involved. Expression of genes that encode interacting proteins is

FIG.4. UBCB-mediatedinhibitionofUBR1.Northern analysisof electrophoreticallyfractionatedtotal RNA fromthe S.cereuisiue strain KMY618 (ubrZA ubc2A,Table I) transformed with a plasmid that expressed wild-type UBC2 (or its derivative ubc2-148) from the expressed wild-type UBRl (oran insertion/frameshift allele of UBRl) from the copper-inducible Pcupl promoter. Numbers at the top indicate time after the addition of galactose to cells growing in SR medium. The blots were hybridized simultaneously to UBRZ-and UBC2-specific probes labeled with 32P(see "Experimental Procedures''). Because of different signal intensities from the -0.8-kb UBC2 mRNA and the-7-kh UBRl mRNA, the images shown were produced by autoradiographic exposures of different durations. A, RNA wasisolated fromexponentially growingcells (Ams 1)carrying plasmids that expressed wild-type UBRZ from the Pcupl promoter and wild-type UBC2 from the PGAL~ promoter (strain KM633, Table I) immediately before and 1,2, or 3 h after the addition of galactose to cells growing in SR medium. Note the induction of the UBC2 mRNA in the presence of galactose, and theconcomitant decrease in the level of the UBRl mRNA. B, same as in A but with RNA from cells that expressed ubc2-148 instead of the wild-type UBC2 (strain KMY634, Table I). An underloaded RNA sample was the reason for apparently lower levelsof both the UBRI and UBC2 mRNAs at the 2-hpoint (verifiedby ethidium staining of the gelandby hybridization with a control ACTl probe; see D).C, same as in A but with RNA from cells that expressed an insertion/frameshift ubrl allele (encoding a short N-terminal fragment of Ubrl) instead of the wild-type UBRl (strain KMY635, TableI). D,the RNA blots in A-C were rehybridized with ACTI, the yeast actin gene (see "Experimental Procedures"). Hybridization signals from the UBRZ, UBC2, and ACT2 probes were recorded and quantified using PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The signals from the UBRl probe were normalized to those derived from the ACTl probe in each lane. Plotted are thenormalized UBRZ signals, with the signals at zero time point denoted as "100%".

If the yeastArg-tRNA-protein transferase (encoded by ATEl) is organized similarly to its mammalian counterpart,the mass of theentire targeting complex in S. cereuisiae could be about 1,500 kDa. In uiuo, this complex should be bound to the rest of proteasome at least some of the time. The complete proteolytic machinethat implements the N-end rule is thus a strikinglydiverse assembly of enzymes and binding factors whose combined size is

often coregulated to maintain an appropriate concentration of a multiprotein complex as well as correct stoichiometries of its components. Theeffect of UBC2expression on thelevel of UBRl mRNA (see "Results") isa likely example of such a regulation. The expression of S.cerevisiaegenesencodingNtamidase and Arg-tRNA-protein transferaseappears to be coregulated as well, presumably to maintain correct stoichiometry of these interacting enzymes.` The evidence for coregulation includesthe presence of commonnucleotide sequence motifs in upstream regions of genes that encode components of the N-end rule pathway.6 Acknowledgments-We thank thecolleagueswhosenames arecited in the paper for their gifts of plasmids and strains.
