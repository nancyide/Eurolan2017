Purification of tropomyosin from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and identification of related proteins in Schizosaccharomyces and Physarum

(actin/yeast/microfflaments/cytoskeleton) HAOPING LiU AND ANTHONY BRETSCHER Section of Biochemistry, Wing Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853 Communicated by Leon A. Heppel, October 3, 1988 ABSTRACT Tropomyosin is a key component of the contractile systems found in muscle and nonmuscle cells of higher eukaryotes. Based on properties common to all tropomyosins, we have purified a protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that resembles tropomyosins from higher cells. The yeast protein remains soluble after heat treatment at 900C, has an apparent polypeptide molecular weight of33,000, an isoelectric point of 4.5, a Stokes radius of 3.5 nm, and a sedimentation coefficient of 2.6 S. It binds F-actin in a Mg2+-dependent, KCl-modulated manner, up to a stoichiometry of about 1 polypeptide per 3.0 actin monomers. In all these properties it is very similar to tropomyosins from higher cells. Antigenaffinity-purified antibodies specifically recognize the Mr 33,000 polypeptide among total yeast proteins and crossreact with bovine brain tropomyosin. In addition, the antibodies specifically crossreact with heat-stable Mr 33,000 polypeptides in extracts of Schizosaceharomyces pombe and Physarum polycephalum. Our detection of tropomyosin in lower eukaryotes suggests that they might have contractile systems very similar to those found in higher organisms. Tropomyosin is a major component of the contractile apparatuses of skeletal and smooth muscles as well as of the microfilament arrangements of nonmuscle cells (reviewed in refs. 1 and 2). It is invariably associated with filamentous actin (F-actin), where it is generally believed to be involved in the Ca2+ regulation of the actomyosin interaction: in skeletal muscle it is complexed with troponin (3) and in smooth muscle it may also be involved in regulation in conjunction with caldesmon and calmodulin (reviewed in ref. 4). The similarity of the protein components of the contractile apparatus in smooth muscle with those present in an ordered pattern in stress fibers of nonmuscle cells (including myosin, actin, myosin light-chain kinase, caldesmon, and tropomyosin) has led to the notion that stress fibers may contain "contractile units" analogous to those found in smooth muscle (5). Therefore, in both muscle and nonmuscle cells, tropomyosin probably plays a pivotal role in the regulation of contraction of the actomyosin system. We are interested in undertaking a combined genetic and biochemical analysis of the regulation of contraction, so we chose Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an organism in which the full power of genetics can be applied. It contains a single actin gene that predicts a protein sequence highly homologous to the nonmuscle actins of higher eukaryotes (6, 7), and this gene has been shown to be essential for viability (8); moreover, yeast contains myosin (9, 10). We therefore set out to determine whether yeast contains key regulatory proteins, in particular tropomyosin, and, if so, how the properties of yeast tropomyosin compare with those of higher cell tropoThe publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment.

myosins. We chose tropomyosin not only because of its key role in regulation but also because tropomyosins as a group have distinct features that have been extensively studied at the functional, biochemical, and genetic levels in higher cells (1). To date, however, tropomyosins have only been clearly documented in higher multicellular organisms (2). All tropomyosins so far isolated are highly a-helical, rod-shaped dimeric proteins. They are very acidic proteins that remain native after heating to 90'C and have the distinctive property of requiring a divalent cation in their interaction with F-actin. In this report we use these properties to isolate a protein from yeast extracts and show that it has many characteristics in common with typical nonmuscle cell tropomyosins. In addition, we show that immunologically and functionally related proteins are present in some other lower eukaryotes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Organisms and Culture Conditions. S. cerevisiae 20B-12 (MATa, trpl, gal2, pep4-3) from B. Tye (Cornell University) was used throughout and grown in YEPD medium to late logarithmic phase. Schizosaccharomyces pombe SP223 (leul-32, ade6-216, ura4) from T. Fox (Cornell University) was grown in YEPD medium. The plasmodial and amoeboid forms of Physarum polycephalum (from Carolina Biological, Burlington, NC) were kindly grown and provided by D. Muscarella (Cornell University). Acanthamoeba castellanii was kindly provided by E. Korn (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and grown as described (11). Dictyostelium discoideum strain AX3 was kindly provided by H. Lodish (Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA) and grown as described (12). Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was kindly grown and provided by K. Kindle (Cornell University). Purification of Proteins. Yeast tropomyosin was purified as described in Results. Bovine brain and chicken gizzard tropomyosins (13, 14) and rabbit skeletal muscle actin (15) were purified as described. Immunological Techniques. Production of antibodies to bovine brain tropomyosin has been described (see, for instance, ref. 16). To generate antibodies to the yeast protein, purified Mr 33,000 protein (p33) was run in preparative NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gels, visualized by brief staining with Coomassie blue, excised, and electrophoretically eluted. About 0.2 mg of p33 in phosphate-buffered saline was mixed with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant and injected into one rabbit. On days 21 and 42 the rabbit was given booster injections with about 30 1Lg of the protein in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. On day 54 the antiserum was tested by double diffusion against the purified protein and by immunoblot analysis against total yeast proteins. Affinity-

peptide (p33) could be detected that bound F-actin in

6.9/0.3 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/0.5 mM benzamidine. The cells were broken by passage through a French pressure cell operated at >15,000 psi (103.5 MPa) and the lysate was immediately boiled for 10 min. After cooling to 4°(, the lysate was clarified at 12,000 x g for 20 min. The heat-soluble extract was made to 30%o saturation in ammonium sulfate and clarified by centrifugation, and the ammonium sulfate concentration was increased to 65% saturation. This material was collected by centrifugation, dissolved and dialyzed into 0.2 M KCl/10 mM (KH2PO4IK2HPO4), pH 7.0/1 mM dithiothreitol, clarified by centrifugation, and applied to a 20-ml DE52 (Whatman) anion-exchange column. After the column was washed with 50 ml of this buffer, it was developed with a 200-ml gradient from 0.2 to 0.4 M KCL. The peak fractions ofyeast tropomyosin, which were eluted at 0.3 M KCI, were loaded directly on a 7-ml hydroxylapatite column (HA-Ultrogel, LKB-Pharmacia), which was then washed with 10 ml of 1 M KCl/10 mM (KH2PO4K2HPO4), pH 7.0/1 mM dithiothreitol and developed with a gradient from 10 to 200 mM phosphate. The purified protein was dialyzed into 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (pH 7.0) and concentrated by Iyophilization. The protein was dissolved in a small volume ofF-actin binding buffer and was stable in this buffer for at least 1 year at 4°C. We recovered a Mr 33,000 polypeptide and a variable minor Mr 20,000 polypeptide that was almost certainly a degradation product as it is immunologically related to p33 (data not shown). The yield of the protein was about 1 mg from 100 g of wet cells. This indicates that it is present in yeast at a level of at least 0.01% ofthe total cell protein. The physical and chemical properties of the yeast protein were determined and compared with those of equine platelet tropomyosin (Tables 1 and 2). In terms of its polypeptide molecular weight (33,000), isoelectric point (4.5), and sedimentation coefficient (2.6 S), p33 is very similar to the higher cell tropomyosin. Its amino acid composition is similar to that of platelet tropomyosin in terms of acidic and basic amino We have explored the interaction of the yeast p33 protein with F-actin by making use of an F-actin cosedimentation assay. Incubation of increasing amounts of p33 with F-actin resulted in a typical saturation curve with an estimated molar ratio of about one p33 polypeptide per 3.0 actin monomers near saturation. This is the same molar ratio found for the binding of platelet tropomyosin to F-actin (20). Use of an excess of the yeast p33 polypeptide in F-actin binding assays demonstrated that the yeast protein bound to F-actin in a Mg2+-dependent manner, with optimal binding occurring above 2.5 mM Mg2+ (Fig. 2A). Binding to F-actin in the presence of Mg2+ was optimal in 50-150 mM KCI (Fig. 2B). Table 1. Comparison of the physical properties of yeast p33 and

Data for platelet tropomyosin are from ref. 19. Under all the conditions used, >90% ofthe actin sedimented, whereas a nondetectable amount of p33 sedimented on its own. Immunological Relationship of Yeast p33, Bovine Brain Tropomyosin, and Proteins Present in Other Lower Eukaryotes. On immunoblots, no crossreaction was detected between an antibody to bovine brain (nonmuscle) tropomyosin and yeast p33 (Fig. 3B). However, antibodies generated to yeast p33 and affinity-purified on immobilized antigen recognize only this protein in total yeast extracts and also crossreact with bovine brain tropomyosin (Fig. 3C), indicating at least some immunological relatedness between these proteins. Interestingly, the antibodies to the yeast protein do not recognize chicken gizzard (smooth muscle) tropomyosin, whereas the antibodies to bovine brain tropomyosin do. Affinity-purified antibodies to the S. cerevisiae protein were used to search for immunologically related proteins in other lower eukaryotes. High-salt extracts of each organism were prepared and boiled, and the heat-soluble proteins were concentrated and subjected to gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with the antibody to the S. cerevisiae protein p33.

Biochemistry: Liu and Bretscher were determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 4, lanes D, E, d, and e). Under the conditions used, about 50% of the immunologically related peptide sedimented with F-actin, whereas none sedimented on its own. DISCUSSION We describe the identification ofa protein from S. cerevisiae that has many properties in common with higher cell nonmuscle tropomyosins, but also some notable differences. All tropomyosins so far characterized migrate with an anomalously high apparent molecular weight in urea/NaDodSO4 gels, although the basis for this effect is not known. Surprisingly, the yeast p33 protein does not show this property (data not shown). In preliminary experiments we have not observed a stimulation of the skeletal muscle actomyosin ATPase by the yeast protein, as is found for smooth muscle tropomyosin (21). However, the physical properties of the yeast protein and the way in which it binds to F-actin in a saturable, Mg2+-dependent manner are very characteristic of a typical tropomyosin (see, for example, ref. 20). One surprising feature of the amino acid composition was the presence, albeit low, of proline residues. Tropomyosins contain >90%o a-helix and are typically devoid of helix-breaking proline residues. Results to be presented elsewhere on the protein sequence derived from the DNA sequence indicate no proline residues; the apparent presence of these residues in our sample must be due to contamination. The biochemical data therefore strongly suggest that the S. cerevisiae protein is closely related to higher cell tropomyosins, and immunological data indicate a relationship between the yeast protein and higher cell nonmuscle tropomyosins. Our recent molecular genetic experiments reveal that S. cerevisiae contains a single gene for this protein, and the DNA sequence predicts a polypeptide sequence showing significant homology to tropomyosins (unpublished data). Moreover, localization of the protein by immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that it colocalizes with actin filaments in yeast cells (unpublished data). We believe these results provide overwhelming evidence that the yeast protein is tropomyosin. It is present in yeast as at least 0.01% of the total cell protein, which is about the level expected, as actin is present at about 0.1% of the total protein (22). Lower eukaryotes have been used extensively to study the actomyosin contractile system. Extensive characterization of actin and myosin from Acanthamoeba, Dictyostelium, and Physarum has revealed that these proteins are remarkably similar to their higher cell counterparts (for review, see ref. 23). We have not been able to find any report describing the presence of tropomyosin in yeasts or in these organisms. Our demonstration that S. cerevisiae contains tropomyosin and that related proteins are present in Sch. pombe and the amoeboid phase of P. polycephalum suggests that tropomy-

osins may be present in other lower eukaryotes. In preliminary experiments we have been unable to detect a protein immunologically related to yeast tropomyosin in Acanthamoeba, Dictyostelium, or Chlamydomonas or, surprisingly, in the plasmodial phase ofP. physarum. However, this may simply be a problem of immunological crossreactivity, or low abundance of the proteins, rather than a true absence of tropomyosin from these organisms. The presence of actin (6-8), myosin (9, 10), and now tropomyosin in S. cerevisiae indicates that this organism may have a contractile system similar to that ofhigher cells. It may therefore provide an ideal system in which to undertake a molecular genetic approach to investigate the mechanism and regulation of contraction. We thank many colleagues for their generosity in providing samples of organisms and Lynne Coluccio for discussions and comments on the manuscript.
