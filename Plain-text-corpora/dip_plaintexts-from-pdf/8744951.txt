Schekman The abundance of B-type cyclin-CDK complexes is determined by regulated synthesis and degradation of cyclin subunits. Cyclin proteolysis is required for the final exit from mitosis and for the initiation of a new cell cycle. In extracts from frog or clam eggs, degradation is accompanied by ubiquitination of cyclin. Three genes, CDC16, CDC23, and CSE1 have recently been shown to be required specifically for cyclin B proteolysis in yeast. To test whether these genes are required for cyclin ubiquitination, we prepared extracts from Gl-arrested yeast cells capable of conjugating ubiquitin to the B-type cyclin Clb2. The ubiquitination activity was cell cycle regulated, required Clb2's destruction box, and was low if not absent in cdcl6, cdc23, cdc27, and csel mutants. Furthermore all these mutants were also defective in ubiquitination of another mitotic B-type cyclin, Clb3. The Cdc16, Cdc23, and Cdc27 proteins all contain several copies of the tetratricopeptide repeat and are subunits of a complex that is required for the onset of anaphase. The finding that gene products that are required for ubiquitination of Clb2 and Clb3 are also required for cyclin proteolysis in vivo provides the best evidence so far that cyclin B is degraded via the ubiquitin pathway in living cells. Xenopus homologues of Cdc16 and Cdc27 have meanwhile been shown to be associated with a 20S particle that appears to function as a cell cycle-regulated ubiquitin-protein ligase.

INTRODUCTION In eukaryotic cells, the timing and inter-dependence of DNA replication (S-phase) and mitosis (M-phase) are controlled by oscillations in the activities of cyclindependent kinases (Cdks). Higher eukaryotes have multiple Cdks whereas in yeasts, cell cycle progression requires a single Cdk known as Cdc2 in fission yeast and Cdc28 in budding yeast. Waves of kinase activities are determined to a large extent by cell cycle-dependent synthesis and degradation of Cdk's regulatory cyclin subunits. Entry into M-phase depends on the appearance of B-type cyclins whose associated kinase activity promotes formation of the mitotic spindle. In budding yeast two pairs of related B-type cyclins appearing during S-phase (Clb3,4) and G2 (Clbl,2) are involved in formation and elongation of the spindle (Fitch et al., 1992). Most of the events

that occur when cells exit from mitosis require degradation of mitotic B-type cyclins. Cyclin proteolysis causes a sudden drop in the Cdc2/Cdc28-dependent kinase activity at the onset of or during anaphase (Whitfield et al., 1990; Pines and Hunter, 1991; Hunt et al., 1992; Surana et al., 1993). The introduction of nondegradable cyclin B variants prevents chromosome decondensation, cytokinesis, and disassembly of the mitotic spindle in frog eggs both in vivo and in extracts that undergo multiple cell cycles in vitro (Murray et al., 1989). Similar results have been obtained in clam egg extracts (Luca et al., 1991). Expression of nondegradable B-type cyclins causes yeast cells to arrest with elongated spindles and separated chromosomes in telophase (Surana et al., 1993). Regulated cyclin proteolysis is therefore a key aspect of the cell cycle clock. The mechanism of cyclin degradation has mainly been studied in vitro using extracts from frog or clam eggs. Exogenously added cyclin B remains stable in

whereas it is rapidly degraded in extracts arrested in a "late mitotic" state due to the presence of a nondegradable cyclin fragment (Murray et al., 1989; Luca et al., 1991). Cyclin B proteolysis depends on the destruction box, a degenerate nine-amino acid motif found in the N-termini of A- and B-type cyclins, and on adjacent lysine containing sequences (Glotzer et al., 1991). Cyclin B proteolysis in vitro was shown to be accompanied by the production of cyclin-ubiquitin conjugates (Glotzer et al., 1991). Assembly of multi-ubiquitin chains on a short-lived protein is usually required for its efficient degradation by the 26S proteasome complex. The enzymatic reactions of the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway have thus far been characterized mainly using artificial substrates and only a limited number of natural substrates have been identified (see Ciechanover, 1994). In an ATP-dependent reaction the C-terminus of ubiquitin is first bound to an ubiquitin-activating enzyme (El) forming a thioester intermediate. This "activated" ubiquitin is subsequently transferred to one member of a large family of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), forming a further thioester intermediate. By catalyzing the formation of an isopeptide bond, the E2 enzyme transfers ubiquitin to a lysine residue of the target protein. Repeated transfer of further ubiquitin molecules to particular lysine residues of conjugated ubiquitins gives rise to polyubiquitinated target proteins. The latter reaction requires a third activity called a ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3), which is thought to bind both the E2 enzyme and the target protein. The polyubiquitin chain serves as a recognition marker for the 26S proteasome, which degrades the target protein and releases free ubiquitin (Peters, 1994). Efficient ubiquitination of cyclin B peptides is confined to "mitotic" extracts, suggesting that cell cycle control of cyclin proteolysis could be exerted at the level of ubiquitin conjugation. The finding that cyclinubiquitin conjugates generated in mitotic extracts can be degraded when transferred to interphase extracts suggests that the proteolytic activity of the 26S proteasome (at least toward B-type cyclins) might not be cell cycle regulated (Peters et al., 1994). The ubiquitination activity of clam egg extracts can be fractionated into three components: a nonspecific El, a cyclin-specific E2, and a large 20S complex that meets the criteria of a ubiquitin-protein ligase (Hershko et al., 1994; Sudakin et al., 1995). The activities of the El and the E2 fractions were not cell cycle regulated. The 20S ubiquitin-protein ligase was only active after isolation from the mitotic extract although it was also present in the interphase extract. Few if any of the proteins involved in destruction box-mediated ubiquitination of cyclin B have been identified with certainty. Mutations in the UBC9 gene, which encodes an E2 enzyme, and in genes that en792

code proteasome subunits (CIM3/SUG1, CIM5, and mts2 ), cause yeast cells to arrest in G2- or M-phase (Ghislain et al., 1993; Gordon et al., 1993; Seufert et al., 1995). However, it is still unclear whether these cell cycle arrests are due to defects in cyclin proteolysis per se rather than some other proteolytic defect that prevents the mutants from reaching the cell cycle stage at which cyclin proteolysis is activated. It has recently been discovered that cyclin proteolysis in yeast, although activated during anaphase, persists during the subsequent Gl period until re-activation of the Cdc28 kinase through the accumulation of Clnl and Cln2 cyclins in late Gl (Amon et al., 1994). By screening for mutations that permit accumulation of the Clb2 B-type cyclin in cells arrested in Gl by Clncyclin depletion, Irniger et al. (1995) identified three genes needed for cyclin B proteolysis: CDC16, CDC23, and CSE1. Subsequent work showed that SRP1, which encodes the nuclear import factor importin, is also required, suggesting that factors involved in nuclear transport have a role in cyclin B proteolysis (Loeb et al., 1995). CDC16, CDC23, and the related CDC27 gene encode essential proteins that are required for the metaphase to anaphase transition. All three proteins contain several copies of a 34-amino acid motif called the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) (Goebl and Yanagida, 1991) and have been shown to be subunits of a complex (Lamb et al., 1994). The metaphase arrest of cdc16 and cdc23 mutants cannot be explained by their failure to degrade known mitotic cyclins because their hyperaccumulation does not inhibit the onset of anaphase (Surana et al., 1993). It has therefore been proposed that these TPR proteins might also be involved in the degradation of proteins that inhibit sister chromatid separation. Studies using frog egg extracts have also suggested that ubiquitin conjugation might be involved in sister chromatid separation (Holloway et al., 1993). To address whether CDC16, CDC23, and CSE1 are needed for cyclin B ubiquitination or for some other step in cyclin proteolysis, we prepared cell free extracts from yeast that are capable of cell cycle-regulated and destruction box-dependent ubiquitination of Clb2. We show here that extracts from Gl-arrested cdcl6, cdc23, cdc27, and csel mutants are defective in ubiquitination of Clb2 and another mitotic B-type cyclin, Clb3. The finding that genes required for Clb2 and Clb3 ubiquitination in vitro are essential for cyclin proteolysis in vivo provides compelling evidence that cyclin B is degraded by the ubiquitin pathway in living cells. In the course of our studies, antibodies against human homologues of Cdc16 and Cdc27 were shown to recognize two subunits of a 20S particle that functions as an ubiquitin-protein ligase and promotes destruction box-dependent cyclin B ubiquitination in frac-

tionated extracts from Xenopus eggs (King et al., 1995). Furthermore, antibodies specific for Cdc27 were shown to block anaphase in human cells (Tugendreich et al., 1995). The activity of the TPR protein-containing particle called the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) or cyclosome therefore seems to be conserved from yeast to humans. MATERIALS AND METHODS Media, Growth Conditions, and Cell Cycle Arrest Yeast strains were grown in rich medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 50 mg/l adenine) containing 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, and 2% of either glucose (YEPPjD) or raffinose (YEPPiraff). To induce expression from the GAL promoter, 2% galactose was added to a culture pregrown in YEPPiraff. Cells were grown to exponential phase by diluting ovemight cultures into fresh medium to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.2 and growing them to an OD600 of 0.5. barl cells were arrested in Gl by addition of a-factor pheromone to 0.4 ,ug/ml. BAR1 strains (K5526, K5527, and K5934) were grown at 25°C from OD6o0 0.2 to 0.5 and a-factor was added to 5 ,ug/ml followed by a second addition to 5 gg/ml after 1.5 h. Cells were harvested 1.5 h later. Cells were arrested in M-phase by addition of nocodazole to 15 ,ug/ml. To arrest cells using a cdc mutation, cultures pregrown at 25'C were transferred to a water bath set at 37°C. Cultures were arrested for 2.5-3.5 h and the arrest was confirmed by microscopic examination and flow cytometric analysis. The DNA content of cells stained with propidium iodide was measured on a Becton Dickinson FACScan (San Jose, CA) as described by Epstein and Cross (1992). Yeast Strains and Plasmid Constructions The genotypes of yeast strains used in this study are shown in Table 1. Except K5526, K5527, and K5934 all strains are derivatives of W303 (K699). K5526, K5527, and K5934 were derived from SUB328. In this strain, all four UBI genes are deleted and the parts encoding ribosomal proteins are expressed separately. Viability depends on a URA3 marked plasmid expressing wild-type ubiquitin (pUB146) from the GAL promoter (Finley et al., 1994; Spence et al., 1995). pUB146 was replaced by the 2 , plasmids YEp96, YEp1O5 (Ellison and Hochstrasser, 1991), or pJD421 (Dohmen et al., 1995), which direct expression of wild-type ubiquitin, a myc-epitope-tagged variant, or a hexahistidine-tagged variant, respectively, from the CUPI promoter (strains kindly provided by J. Dohmen). K5526, K5527, and K5934 were obtained after disruption of the PEP4 gene using pTS15. All pep4 derivatives were obtained by genetic crosses or by one-step gene disruption. Strains were transformed with pTS15 (pep4::URA3) cut with EcoRI-XhoI or pTS17 (pep4::LEU2) cut with BamHI. pep4 disruption was verified by a color assay as described by Jones (1977). To express Clb2ha3, Clb2ADBha3, or Clb3ha3 from the GALIO promoter, several copies of pWZV1, pWZV4, or c3190, respectively, were integrated at the ura3 locus. The plasmids were cut with ApaI in the URA3 sequence and transformed into K1534 giving strains K5515, K5516, or K5935. Strains K5515 and K5516 were selected to express Clb2ha3 and Clb2ADBha3, respectively, to equivalent levels. pWZV1 consists of the GAL10 promoter on a BamHI-EcoRI fragment fused to an EcoRIAsp718 fragment containing CLB2 sequences from the start codon to position +1803 (ATG = +1) in the URA3-based integrative vector YIplac211 (Gietz and Sugino, 1988). The CLB2 sequence contains a triple hemagglutinin epitope tag (ha3) (Tyers et al., 1993) inserted into a NotI site in front of the stop codon (Lin and Amdt, 1995). pWZV4 is a derivative of pWZV1 containing a deletion of the destruction box (Surana et al., 1993). In c3190 the GALIO promoter is fused to an EcoRI-SalI fragment containing CLB3 sequences from the start codon to position + 1415 (ATG = +1; Fitch et al., 1992) with Vol. 7, May 1996

Preparation of Extracts Protein extracts for the ubiquitination assay were prepared from 350 ml cultures grown to an OD600 of 0.5 and arrested for 2.5-3.5 h. Cells

were collected on membrane filters and resuspended in 30 ml of 0.1 M Tris-H2SO4, pH 9.5, 10 mM dithiothreitol. After 3 min cells were washed with 30 ml spheroplast medium (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.2 M sorbitol, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.3 x YEP, 0.5% carbon source) and resuspended in 15 ml of the same medium containing 0.5 mg lyticase (Sigma L5763; St. Louis, MO). Carbon source and incubation temperature were chosen according to the conditions used to arrest the cells. For cells arrested with pheromone or nocodazole the spheroplast medium was supplemented with a-factor (0.5 ,tg/ml for barl; 5 ,ug/ml for BARI) or nocodazole (15 ,ug/ml). Usually more than 90% of cells were converted to spheroplasts after 10-20 min as judged by microscopic examination of samples containing 1% SDS. The following steps were carried out at 0-4°C. The spheroplast suspension was diluted to 50 ml with ice cold 1.2 M sorbitol. Spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation (500 x g, 2 min), washed once in 50 ml sorbitol, and collected again (1700 x g, 2 min). The spheroplasts were resuspended in 0.3 volumes of buffer A (150 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid [HEPES]-KOH, pH 7.3,180 mM sodium acetate, 15 mM magnesium acetate, 30% glycerol, 3 mM dithiothreitol, 0.3 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 ,ug/ml pepstatin) and disrupted by shaking with 0.3 ml of glass beads (0.5 mm) for 4 min. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation for 5 min in an Eppendorf micro-centrifuge and the supernatant was used for the ubiquitination assay. Extracts from

W. Zachariae and K. Nasmyth strains overexpressing epitope-tagged Clb2 or Clb3 were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay (Richmond, CA) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The protein concentration of extracts was 30-40 mg/ml.

Ubiquitination Assay and Western Analysis

Extracts were normalized for protein concentration before the assay. Reactions containing 32 ,ul extract, 4 ,ul 1ox ATP regenerating system (10 mM ATP, 600 mM creatine phosphate, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 1.5 mg/ml creatine kinase in 0.3 x buffer A) and 2 ,ul Clb2ha3, Clb2ADBha3, or Clb3ha3 extract in a total volume of 40 ,ul were incubated for 5 min at the temperatures indicated. Some reactions contained 2 ,1. of yeast ubiquitin (Sigma U2129, 20 mg/ml in 0.3 x buffer A). Reactions were diluted 1:5 into hot SDS sample buffer and incubated for 5 min at 95°C. Samples of 25 ,ul were separated by electrophoresis on 8% SDS polyacrylamide gels and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). Uniform transfer of proteins was confirmed by staining the membranes with 0.2% Ponceau S in 0.3% trichloroacetic acid. After blocking in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 4% nonfat dry milk, membranes were incubated with the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody directed against the hemagglutinin epitope (Field et al., 1988). A horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG served as a secondary antibody. Epitope-tagged cyclin and cyclin-ubiquitin conjugates were visualized using the enhanced chemoluminescence detection system purchased from Amersham (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). A short exposure (10 s) was used to confirm that each reaction received an equal amount of epitope-tagged cyclin. For detection of cyclin-ubiquitin conjugates blots were exposed for 5-15 min to autoradiography films. Purification of Clb2-Ubiquitin Conjugates Extracts were prepared from a-factor-arrested cells of K5934 and K5526, which express 6-histidine-ubiquitin or the wild-type protein, respectively. Thirty-two microliters of extract were incubated with the ATP regenerating system and 2 ,ul of Clb2ha3-extract in the presence or absence of exogenous ubiquitin (1 mg/ml) in a total volume of 40 ,ul for 5 min at 25°C. To check the formation of Clb2ha3-ubiquitin conjugates, 5-,ul samples were removed, mixed with SDS sample buffer, and incubated at 95°C. Meanwhile 665 ,ul buffer 1 (6 M guanidinium-HCl, 0.1 M sodium phosphate, 10 mM Tris, adjusted to pH 8.0 with NaOH) containing 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide were added to the remaining 35 ,ul of each reaction followed by 120 ,ul of 50% nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in buffer 1. Imidazole was added to a final concentration of 2 mM and the suspensions were incubated with end-over-end rotation at 4°C overnight. The resins were applied to Bio-Rad Econo-columns and successively washed with the following buffers: 1.2 ml buffer 1, 1.2 ml buffer 2 (buffer 1 adjusted to pH 6.0), 1.2 ml buffer 3 (buffer 1 containing 5 M urea instead of guanidinium-HCl), 0.6 ml buffer 3 plus 10 mM imidazole, and 0.6 ml buffer 3 plus 50 mM imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted with 0.6 ml buffer 3 containing 0.5 M imidazole. The latter fractions were concentrated to 50 ,ul using Centricon-10 filtration devices (Amicon, Beverly, MA). Samples were mixed with SDS sample buffer, incubated at 37°C for 5 min, and loaded onto a SDS polyacrylamide gel. Purification of conjugates consisting of Clb2ha3 and 6His-ubiquitin was analyzed by Western blotting using the 12CA5 antibody. RESULTS Ubiquitination of Clb2 in a Cell-free Extract To reconstitute cyclin ubiquitination in vitro, we used as a substrate a full-length Clb2 protein synthesized in 794

yeast, because previous work had suggested that truncated Clb2 proteins lacking C-terminal sequences are not properly degraded in vivo (Irniger and Nasmyth, personal communication). A version of Clb2 carrying three copies of the hemagglutinin epitope tag at its C-terminus (Clb2ha3) was expressed in yeast under the control of the galactose-inducible GALl-10 promoter. Induction with galactose of a strain carrying approximately 18 copies of pGAL-CLB2ha3 caused mitotic arrest and led to the accumulation of large amounts of soluble Clb2ha3 protein. A small aliquot of an extract prepared from these cells was incubated with an excess of an extract made from cells arrested in Gi, which also contained an ATP regenerating system. Clb2ha3 protein and derivatives of higher molecular weight produced by conjugation to ubiquitin were detected by Western blotting using an anti-ha monoclonal antibody. Ubiquitination of Clb2 was inefficient in extracts prepared from whole cells, possibly because a strong ATPase activity associated with yeast cell walls leads to rapid ATP depletion (Deshaies and Kirschner, 1995). Protein extracts were therefore prepared from spheroplasts generated by treating cells with lyticase. To reduce nonspecific protein degradation during incubation of extracts, we found it necessary to use strains lacking the PEP4 gene. Clb2ha3 was added to an extract prepared from wild-type cells previously arrested in Gl with pheromone. In the presence of an ATP regenerating system, a small fraction of Clb2ha3 was converted to a ladder of high molecular weight derivatives (Figure 1A, lane 2). These products were not formed when the ATP regenerating system (Figure 1A, lane 3), the Gl extract (Figure 1A, lane 1), or the Clb2ha3-containing extract (Figure 1A, lane 5) were omitted from the reaction. Few high molecular weight products were formed when an extract prepared from cells overexpressing (to equivalent levels as Clb2ha3) a version of Clb2ha3 lacking its destruction box was used as a source of substrate (Figure 1A, lane 4). However, conversion of Clb2ha3 into high molecular weight products was not influenced by exogenously added ubiquitin (Figure 1B). To test whether the high molecular weight products consist of cyclin-ubiquitin conjugates, we used yeast strains containing deletions in all four ubiquitin genes, whose survival is sustained by individual ubiquitin genes present on plasmids (Finley et al., 1994; Spence et al., 1995). Extracts were prepared from Gl-arrested cells of strains expressing ubiquitin fused to a mycepitope tag or the wild-type protein. The high molecular weight derivatives of Clb2ha3 produced in the extract from the myc-ubiquitin strain showed a different pattern than those generated in the extract from the control strain (Figure 1B, lanes 2 and 4). The altered pattern was restored to the wild-type pattern by the addition of yeast ubiquitin to the myc-ubiquitinMolecular Biology of the Cell


containing extract (Figure 1B, lanes 4 and 5). This result indicates that the two ubiquitin versions compete for incorporation into the high molecular weight derivatives of Clb2ha3. In the experiment shown in Figure 1C, Clb2ha3 was added to extracts from strains expressing a hexahistidine-tagged version of ubiquitin or the wild-type protein. Proteins containing a stretch of histidines can be purified by nickel-chelate chromatography on NTAagarose (Hochuli et al., 1987, 1988). Also, the 6Hisubiquitin caused an alteration in the pattern of high molecular weight Clb2ha3 derivatives (Figure 1C, lanes 2 and 4). In the presence of exogenously added ubiquitin, high molecular weight products similar to those produced by the control extract were generated (Figure 1C, lanes 4 and 5). Reactions were diluted with a buffer containing 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride and incubated with nickel-NTA-agarose. These denaturing conditions prevent degradation or deubiquitination of ubiquitin-protein conjugates as well as any noncovalent protein-protein interaction but do not in-

Ubiquitination of Clbs terfere with binding of the hexahistidine tag to the affinity resin. After washing, bound proteins were eluted with imidazole and analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Figure 1C, Clb2ha3 containing conjugates could be isolated from the 6His-ubiquitin extract (Figure 1C, lanes 4 and 9) but not from the control reaction (Figure 1C, lanes 2 and 7). In the presence of exogenously added ubiquitin, the 6His-ubiquitin extract produced conjugates that did not bind efficiently to nickel-NTA-agarose (Figure 1C, lanes 5 and 10). Similar results were obtained with a ha3-tagged version of Clb3 (our unpublished results). We conclude that the high molecular weight products produced in the in vitro reaction consist of cyclin-ubiquitin conjugates. Ubiquitination of Clb2 In Vitro Is Cell Cycle Regulated Clb2 protein is rapidly degraded from late anaphase until the end of the subsequent Gl-phase but stable

After washing with 0.05 M imidazole, bound proteins were eluted with 0.5 M imidazole (lanes 6-10). Clb2ha3 and Clb2ha3-ubiquitin conjugates were detected by Western blotting.

W. Zachariae and K. Nasmyth during S, G2, and early stages of mitosis (Amon et al., 1994). To check whether ubiquitination of Clb2 in vitro was cell cycle regulated, we prepared extracts from

cells arrested at different stages of the cell cycle. Clb2ha3 ubiquitination was also high in extracts from cells arrested in Gl by the cdc28-4 mutation, which is consistent with the finding that Cdc28 function is not required for Clb2 proteolysis during Gl (Amon et al., 1994). In contrast, extracts prepared from cells arrested in G2 (cdcl3-1) or M-phase (nocodazole) had little or no activity (Figure 2A). In addition, extracts from a cdc15-2 mutant arrested in late anaphase did not show efficient ubiquitination of Clb2ha3 (Figure 2B), which is consistent with the finding that cdc15-2 mutants arrest with an elevated concentration of Clb2 protein and Clb2-associated kinase activity (Surana et al., 1993). The cell cycle dependence of Clb2ha3 ubiquitination in vitro is therefore similar to that of Clb2 proteolysis in vivo.

Genes Needed for Ubiquitination of Mitotic Cyclins Irniger et al. (1995) have identified three genes, CDC16, CDC23, and CSE1, which are required for Clb2 proteolysis during Gi. Ectopically expressed Clb2 accumulates in Gl-arrested cells even at the permissive temperature in cdc23-1 and csel-22 mutants but only at the restrictive temperature in cdcl6-123 mutants. To address whether the defective Clb2 proteolysis in cdcI6, cdc23, and csel mutants could be due to defective ubiquitination, we prepared extracts from mutant and wild-type cells after pheromone-induced Gl arrest. Cells were grown and subsequently treated with pheromone at 25°C, the mutant's permissive temperature. Each arrest was checked by flow cytometric analysis (Figure 3D). Destruction box-dependent ubiquitination of Clb2ha3 was greatly reduced in extracts prepared from cdcl6-123, cdc23-1, and csel-22 mutants, even when the reactions were performed at 25°C (Figure 3, A-C). The cdc23-1 and csel-22 mutations caused a stronger defect than the cdcl6-123 mutation when extracts were prepared from Gl-arrested cells kept at 25°C. The residual activity of the cdc16123 extract was reduced to background levels by a short incubation (30 min) of the arrested cells at 37°C. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed that cells remained arrested in Gl (our unpublished results). These data are consistent with the finding that Clb2 proteolysis is temperature sensitive in cdcl6-123 mutants whereas it is already impaired at the permissive temperature in cdc23-1 and csel-22 mutants (Irniger et al., 1995). CDC16 and CDC23 encode proteins that form a complex with another TPR containing protein encoded by CDC27 (Lamb et al., 1994). The cdc27-1 mutation also reduced ubiquitination of Clb2ha3 but to a lesser extent than the other mutations (Figure 4). Ubiquitination in vitro is more severely affected by the cdc27-1 mutation than Clb2 proteolysis in vivo, which is barely if at all reduced. The residual ubiquitination activity in a cdc27-1 mutant might be sufficient to prevent accumulation of Clb2 to detectable levels. These data are consistent with the notion that Clb2 proteolysis depends on destruction box-dependent ubiquitination of Clb2 mediated by the the Cdc1623-27 complex. With respect to primary sequence and expression pattern the four mitotic cyclins of budding yeast form two pairs: Clbl,2 and Clb3,4. Clb3,4 appear earlier in the cell cycle than Clbl,2 and all disappear at the end of mitosis (Grandin and Reed, 1993). As shown in Figure 5, a version of Clb3 containing a triple ha tag at its C-terminus is strongly ubiquitinated by an extract from Gl-arrested wild-type cells. Extracts from Glarrested cdcl6-123, cdc23-1, cdc27-1, and csel-22 mutants were clearly defective in ubiquitination of Clb3ha3. These data are consistent with the notion that Molecular Biology of the Cell

Ubiquitination of Clbs sible that either gene product is sufficient. We could not test the phenotype of double mutants because they are lethal in our strain background (W303) or grow so slowly in others that it might not be possible to obtain reliable results. Conditional alleles will probably be required to address this issue. In clam extracts, a cyclin-specific E2 enzyme called E2-C was found that cannot be replaced by recombinant Ubc4 (Hershko et al., 1994; Sudakin et al., 1995). A mutation in the UBC9 gene leading to a growth defect at 37°C did not affect Clb2 ubiquitination in extracts from Gi cells. The anaphase arrest of cdc16, cdc23, and cdc27 mutants cannot be easily explained by defects in the proteolysis of cyclins alone. For example, expression of nondegradable Clb2 in yeast inhibits not anaphase but the subsequent disassembly of the mitotic spindle. It has therefore been proposed that the APC promotes ubiquitination not only of cyclins but also that of other proteins whose destruction is needed for the onset of anaphase. TPR proteins have been implicated in specific protein-protein interactions (Tzamarias and Struhl, 1995) and it is possible that different substrates are recognized via different TPR motifs. Activation of the APC, at least toward proteins (yet to be discovered) that inhibit sister chromatid separation, could be a key step in the onset of anaphase. How this process is controlled is therefore an important question. Several pieces of evidence suggest that prior activation of cyclin B-Cdkl kinases might be a key step (Felix et al., 1990), but this is neither necessary for maintaining APC activity during Gl in yeast (Amon et al., 1994; Irniger et al., 1995) nor is it sufficient for activating the APC when the mitotic spindle is damaged. Most cells use surveillance mechanisms called checkpoint controls to prevent the onset of anaphase when the mitotic spindle has not been properly assembled. Microtubule depolymerizing agents like nocodazole cause cells to arrest in a state with stable B-type cyclins and high Cdc2/Cdc28 kinase activity. Several genes have recently been identified that are required for this cell cycle arrest (Hoyt et al., 1991; Li and Murray, 1991). It is tempting to speculate that the mitotic checkpoint genes or even those that register DNA damage, function at least partly by preventing activation of the APC. This new major cell cycle player may turn out not only to be a highly conserved component of eukaryotic cells but also to have many key roles in regulating their cell cycles.
