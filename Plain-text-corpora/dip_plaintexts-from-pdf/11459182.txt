Characterization of Gac1p, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase type I involved in glycogen accumulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

glycogen synthase (Gsy2p). To investigate the role of Gac1p in this process, a set of GAC1 deletions were tested for their ability to complement a gac1 null mutation and to associate with Glc7p and with Gsy2p. The N-terminal 93 amino acids of Gac1p are necessary and sucient for the interaction with Glc7p, whereas a region spanning residues 130±502 is required for Gsy2p binding. Both domains are required for full activity in vivo, although the Glc7p-binding domain retains some residual activity and can alter the phosphorylase a phosphatase activity of Glc7p in vitro. Further mutational analysis showed that Val71 and Phe73 of Gac1p are necessary for binding to Glc7p, while Asn356 and Tyr357 of Gac1p are necessary for binding to Gsy2p. These results suggest that Gac1p targets PP1 to its substrate Gsy2p and that Gac1p may alter the catalytic activity of PP1. Our data also show that overexpression of Gac1p aects glucose repression and ion homeostasis, two additional targets of GLC7, suggesting that multiple regulatory subunits compete for Glc7p binding in vivo.

Introduction In mammals, type 1 Ser/Thr protein phosphatase (PP1) regulates various cellular processes including glycogen metabolism (Cohen 1989), RNA splicing (Mermoud et al. 1994; Hirano et al. 1996), cell cycle control (Fernandez et al. 1992), and muscle contraction (Cohen 1989). The PP1 holoenzymes responsible for these diverse activities dier with respect to their regulatory or targeting subunits, which target the PP1 catalytic subunit to speci®c subcellular locations and/or alter its speci®c activity (Cohen and Cohen 1989; Hubbard and Cohen 1993). The glycogen-associated forms of PP1, which are heterodimers composed of the catalytic subunit PP1c and a glycogen-binding subunit, RGl/GM (Tang et al. 1991), GL (Doherty et al. 1995) or PTG (Printen et al. 1997), serve as the paradigm for this model. These glycogen-binding subunits target PP1c to glycogen particles and change the phosphatase activity toward glycogen metabolic enzymes including glycogen synthase, phosphorylase, and phosphorylase kinase (Hubbard and Cohen 1993; Brady et al. 1997). In an analogous manner, the muscle-speci®c PP1 subunit M110 targets the muscle holoenzyme to myosin and enhances its activity towards myosin light chain (Alessi et al. 1992; Chen et al. 1994). Additional PP1-binding proteins have been identi®ed, suggesting that dierent PP1 holoenzymes exist in the cell to allow PP1c to participate in a wide variety of cellular pathways. Our basic understanding of the interactions between catalytic and regulatory subunits has been dramatically advanced by the elucidation of the structure of PP1c co-crystallized with a 13-residue peptide from GM (GM[63±75]) (Eglo et al. 1997). This structure reveals that the residues of GM that directly contact PP1c (R65V66-S67-F68) constitute a motif (RVXF) that is often found in PP1c-binding proteins. A similar consensus

Mutation analysis demonstrates that the conserved. conserved motif V71XF73 is necessary for Glc7p binding, The yeast S. cerevisiae has a single PP1c subunit, while residues N356 and Y357 are crucial for Gsy2p hereafter referred to as Glc7p, rather than the multiple binding.

624 Plasmid construction Plasmids are listed in Table 2 and oligonucleotides used in all PCRs are listed in Table 3. To construct pHH2, pHH4, pHH6, pHH8, pHH10, pHH12, pHH39, pHH45, and pHH49 for use in the twohybrid assay, GAC1 fragments were ampli®ed by PCR using the high-®delity Pfu polymerase. BamHI sites were added to both upstream and downstream primers so that the GAC1 gene was in the same reading frame as the GAL4 activation domain encoded by the pACTII vector. The fragments were ®rst cloned into the BamHI site of pBluescript SK to utilize the blue/white screening method, and were then cloned into the BamHI site of pACTII. This fused the GAC1 fragments with the Gal4 activation domain under the control of the ADH promoter. To construct pHH149, the GLC7 coding region was ampli®ed by PCR using Pfu polymerase. The PCR primers GLC7-5¢ and GLC7-3¢ introduce BamHI sites at both ends of the product. The GLC7 gene was fused in frame to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in the yeast two-hybrid vector pAS1-CYH2 at the BamHI site (Durfee et al. 1993). To construct pHH106, GSY2 was ampli®ed by PCR using Pfu polymerase. The upstream primer (GSY2-1) contained an NcoI site in frame with the twohybrid vector, and the downstream primer (GSY2-8) inserted a SalI site. The PCR product was cloned into the NcoI-Sal I sites of pAS1-CYH2. To construct pHH13, pHH15, pHH17, pHH20, pHH22, pHH23, pHH92, and pHH98, which were used in immunoprecipitation and functional assays, DNA encoding a myc epitope tag (EQKLISEEDLN) was introduced into the upstream PCR primer between the second and the third codons of GAC1. The fragments were ®rst cloned into the BamHI site of pBluescript SK

and then into the BamHI site of the pG1 vector (Schena et al. 1991), placing the myc-tagged GAC1 genes under the control of the constitutive glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) promoter. Correct orientations were con®rmed by restriction enzyme digestion. To construct pWU21, pWU24, pWU26, pWU53, and pWU299, point mutations were ®rst generated in full-length GAC1 in pBluescript SK (pHH78) as described below, and then the BamHI fragments containing the full-length GAC1, which contained point mutations, were excised and cloned into the BamHI site of pACTII. To construct pWU28, pWU31, and pWU34, the BamHI fragments of full-length Gac1p containing point mutations were excised and inserted into the BamHI site of pG1. To construct pWU297 and pWU298, the 2.2-kb BamHI-EcoRI fragment containing the native GAC1 promoter and the ®rst 141 codons from pNAS7-1 (Francois et al. 1992) was inserted into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pRS316 (pRS316-GAC1-NH2), then the 1.9-kb EcoRI fragment encoding the C-terminal portion of Gac1 (aa 141±794) containing the mutations and carried in pBluescript SK was inserted into the EcoRI site of pRS316-GAC1-NH2. To construct pWU158, the BamHI fragment containing myc-tagged GAC11±169 was excised from pHH15 and inserted into the BamHI site of the pET30C expression vector. Orientation was checked by digestion with NcoI. This construct encodes 6 ´ His-tagged Gac1p1±169. The sequences of all DNA fragments generated by PCR were determined by the sequencing facility at Iowa State University. We found that all of our GAC1 constructs contained a Asp to Val missense mutation in position 160. Either this is a polymorphism or the mutation arose prior to use as our PCR template. No additional mutations were found.

Site-directed mutagenesis Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's protocol.

used to generate the K69A mutation; primers V71A+ and V71A) as described previously (Celenza and Carlson 1984). were used to generate the V71A mutation; primers F73A+ and

F73A) were used to generate the F73A mutation; primers NY+ and NY) were used to generate the motif II mutation; and primers GAC418+ and GAC418- were used to generate the motif III mutation. Mutations were screened by DNA sequencing using the Sequenase kit 2.0 (Amersham Life Science). The entire sequence of each GAC1 mutant was determined and no additional mutations were found. The GAC1 genes containing desired mutations were then cloned into the BamHI site of pACTII for two-hybrid assay or into the BamHI site of pG1 vector for expression in yeast. Biochemical and analytical procedures Immunoprecipitation analysis and Western analysis were performed as previously described (Stuart et al. 1994). For qualitative glycogen assays, yeast cells were grown on SD plates at30°C or 37°C and stained with iodinevapors (Chester1968). For quantitative glycogen assays, yeast cells were grown in liquid minimal medium. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and glycogen was converted to glucose as described (FrancË ois et al. 1987). For enzyme activity assays, wild-type Glc7p and mutant Glc7-1p(R73C) were partially puri®ed from strains KT1100 (GLC7, gac1) and KT1098 (glc7±1), respectively, as described by Connor et al. (1998). Protein phosphatase activity was assayed using a kit from GibcoBRL according to the manufacturer's protocol. Rabbit glycogen phosphorylase a was labeled with c-32P[ATP] and used as a substrate. Aliquots (20-ll) of P-labeled

32

rabbit phosphorylase a (10 lM ®nal concentration) were incubated at 30°C for 10 min with Glc7p or Glc7±1p(R73C) in the presence of increasing amounts of Gac1p1±169. The reaction was stopped by

Expression and puri®cation of an N-terminal fragment of Gac1p in E. coli pWU158 was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). Overnight cultures (2.5 ml) were inoculated into 500 ml of LB medium containing 50 lg/ml of kanamycin. After growth at 37°C for 3±4 h to an OD600 of 0.6, IPTG was added to a ®nal concentration of 1 mM and cells were grown for an additional 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000´g, at 4°C for 15 min. Since the recombinant Gac1p was insoluble, puri®cation was carried out under denaturing conditions. To the cell pellet, 20 ml of lysis buer (5 mM imidazole, 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM TRIS-HCl pH 7.9, 6 M urea) was added. The cells were resuspended, passed through a 20 g needle three times to shear DNA and then rocked at 4°C overnight. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000´g at 4°C for 15 min and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Then 4 ml of the Ni-NTA agarose slurry (Qiagen) was added to the supernatant and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 40 min. The Ni-NTA resin was then pelleted at 700 rpm for 1 min in a table-top centrifuge and washed with 20 ml of lysis buer. The resin was washed with 20-ml aliquots of lysis buer containing successively lower concentrations of urea, i.e., 5 M urea for 3 h, 4 M for 3 h, 3 M overnight, 2 M, 1 M, 0.5 M and 0 M for 2 h, respectively. The protein was then eluted with 1 M imidazole, 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM TRIS-HCl pH 7.9, and dialyzed against dialysis buer [50 mM TRIS-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM b-mercaptoethanol (b-ME)] overnight. Protein was then dialyzed against the same buer plus 10% glycerol for 5 h. The solution was clari®ed by centrifugation at 10,000´g at 4 °C for 10 min before storage at ±80°C.


626 Results Construction of gac1 deletion mutants Previous studies on GAC1 revealed that a yeast expression plasmid encoding only the N-terminal 502 amino acid residues could fully complement the gac1 null mutant (Francois et al. 1992). To more thoroughly characterize GAC1, we used a set of deletion mutants lacking parts of the coding sequence, which were constructed by PCR ampli®cation (Fig. 1A). In each case, a sequence encoding a myc epitope was inserted near the GAC1 5¢ end to facilitate biochemical analysis. These deletion mutants were expressed both as fusion proteins from the two-hybrid vector pACTII, to assay protein-protein interactions, and directly in yeast, to assay for biological activity. To assay in vivo activity of the gac1 deletions, each construct was cloned downstream of the constitutive GPD promoter in the vector pG1 (Schena et al. 1991) and transformed into a gac1::LEU2 strain (strain

KT1100). Transformants were assayed for glycogen levels using both qualitative and quantitative assays. To con®rm that the mutant proteins were expressed in the transformants, immunoblot analysis was performed using the anti-myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody (Evan et al. 1985). As shown in Fig. 1B, all truncated proteins were expressed, although the level of expression varied between constructs. Gac1p1±368 and Gac1p1±502 were the most abundant, while Gac1p486±795 accumulated to the lowest level. The levels of expression of the Gac1p fragments are probably much higher than that of wildtype Gac1p since we have previously been unable to detect Gac1 expressed from its native promoter on a low-copy-number vector (Stuart et al. 1994). All Gac1p fragments migrated more slowly than predicted from their mass, as was observed previously for the full-length Gac1p (Stuart et al. 1994). The biological activity of the Gac1p deletions was tested by assaying glycogen levels in the transformants. As shown in Fig. 2, glycogen levels in the transformants fell into three classes. Strains expressing Gac1p deletions that lacked the N-terminal 130 amino acid residues failed to accumulate glycogen above the level seen with the vector control, indicating that the N-terminal segment is essential for activity. In contrast, strains bearing Gac1p proteins that contained only the N-terminal region accumulated intermediate levels of glycogen. Glycogen accumulation in these mutants was temperature-dependent. At 30°C, glycogen levels in cells expressing Gac1p1±169, Gac1p1±129 and Gac1p1±93 were 20%±50% of that found in cells expressing the fulllength clone. However, at 37°C these cells accumulated glycogen at levels that were only slightly higher than that found in the vector control. Strains expressing the third class of deletion mutants (Gac1p1±368, Gac1p1±502) and the full-length Gac1p1±794, all of which retained the wildtype N-terminal region and additional residues in the central portion of the protein, accumulated high levels of glycogen (Fig. 2). These Gac1p fragments also complemented the glycogen de®ciency of a gac1 pig1 double mutant (data not shown), ruling out the possibility that increased expression of Gac1p induces glycogen synthesis by some indirect mechanism that relies on Pig1p.

The ability of the corresponding Gal4768±881Gac1p fragments to interact with Gal41±147-Glc7p and Gal41±147Gsy2p in the two-hybrid system is indicated on the right. b-Galactosidase activities were measured in Miller units, and the means of three independent measurements were calculated. Standard deviations were less than 20% of the means. b-Galactosidase values for the pACT vector with Gal41±147-Glc7p and Gal41±147-Gsy2p were 0.6 units and 0.5 units, respectively. B Immunoblot analysis of myc epitope-tagged Gac1p fragments. Whole cell extracts were prepared from KT1100 (gac1) expressing myc-tagged Gac1p fragments carried in pG1 (GPD promoter). Equal amounts of total protein were loaded onto a 15% polyacrylamide-SDS gel. The Gac1p fragments were detected using antibody directed against the myc epitope and visualized using the ECL System (Amersham). Lanes 1±8 were exposed for 30 s.

To de®ne the region of Gac1p required for this association, we used a set of Gac1p deletions fused to the Gal4 activation domain in the two-hybrid vector pACTII and assayed their interaction with a Gal4-Glc7p fusion expressed from the vector pAS1. Filter assays for b-galactosidase activity indicated that the N-terminal 93 amino acid residues of Gac1p are necessary and sucient for the interaction with Glc7p (Fig. 1A). To con®rm this association in cell extracts, we assayed for the association of Gac1p with

Two independent transformants expressing each Gac1p fragment were patched on SD-Trp plates and incubated at 30°C for 1 day, then replicated onto two SD-Trp plates and incubated for a further 24 h at 30°C or 37°C prior to staining of glycogen with iodine vapors. The relative intensity of the brown color produced in iodine-stained cells correlates with glycogen levels. B Quantitative glycogen assay.

Values represent means  standard deviations for three independent transformants with each GAC1 truncation allele in more than 10% of all proteins, so con®rmation of its role is critical. To con®rm that this sequence plays a role in the interaction between Gac1p and Glc7p, we constructed three missense mutations in GAC1 that result in the alteration of Lys69, Val71 and Phe73 to Ala. The mutants were tested for their interaction with Glc7p in the yeast two-hybrid system and for their ability to complement a gac1 deletion when expressed from their endogenous promoter (Fig. 4).

were prepared from strains expressing both HA-Glc7p and various myc-Gac1p deletions. As shown in Fig. 3, Glc7p co-precipitated with myc-tagged Gac1p1±93 (lane 1), Gac1p1±129 (lane 2) and Gac1p1±169 (lane 3), but not with immunoprecipitated Gac1p130±502 (lane 4). These results con®rm that the predominant Glc7p-binding domain of Gac1p lies within the N-terminal 93 amino acid residues. The myc-Gac1p proteins did not co-precipitate well with HA-Glc7p when anti-HA antibody was used to bring down the latter. Only a small amount of Gac1p1±169 was found in immuno-precipitated HAGlc7p complexes and no Gac1p1±93 or Gac1p1±129 was detected (data not shown). It is possible that antibody binding to the HA epitope at the N-terminus of Glc7p precludes the binding of Gac1p proteins.

For both glycogen levels and b-galactosidase activities, values shown represent the averages for three or four independent transformants. The error bars denote the standard deviations

to complement a gac1::LEU2 null mutant. The V71A mutation attenuated the interaction between Gac1p and Glc7p to a lesser degree and resulted in some reduction in glycogen levels, whereas the K69A variant had little eect on the interaction between Gac1p and Glc7p and allowed high levels of glycogen accumulation. Surprisingly, the K69A mutant complemented a gac1 null mutant and interacted with Glc7p ± even though the lysine residue in the consensus is conserved in most examples. However, others have noted that the Lys in other VXF motif-containing subunits is not essential for binding PP1 (Huang et al. 1999). The strong correlation between biological function and Glc7p binding in these missense mutants corroborates the role of the VXF region in Glc7p binding.

two-hybrid analysis with our collection of pACT-GAC1 clones and pAS-GSY2. As summarized in Fig. 1A, the full-length pACT-GAC1, pAS-GAC11±502, pACTGAC1130±502, and pACT-GAC1130±794 resulted in b-galactosidase expression when expressed with pAS-GSY2. The levels of b-galactosidase activity in transformants containing pAS-GSY2 and pACT-GAC11±93, pACTGAC11±129, pACT-GAC11±169, pACT-GAC11±368, or pACT-GAC1486±794 were similar to the levels in strains carrying only the empty vector. These results suggest that Gsy2p may interact with a domain of Gac1p that lies between amino acid residues 130 and 502. To con®rm the physical interaction between Gsy2p and Gac1p, we assayed for the presence of Gsy2p in immunoprecipitates of Gac1p (Fig. 5). Plasmids expressing myc-tagged Gac1p derivatives were co-transformed with a plasmid expressing a 6´His tagged Gsy2p in a gsy2 null strain (CV218). The myc-Gac1p fragments were immunoprecipitated from extracts prepared from [35S]methionine-labeled cell cultures, and the immunoprecipitates were assayed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography for the presence of the 78-kDa 6´His-Gsy2p. A band corresponding to the molecular weight of Gsy2p was observed in immunoprecipitates from cells expressing Gac1p130±502, Gac1p1±502, and full-length Gac1p, but not in immunoprecipitates of Gac1p1±129, Gac1p1±169 or Gac1p1±368, con®rming that a Gsy2p-interaction domain lies between amino acid residues 130 and 502.

(1997), lies within a more extensive glycogen-binding domain that is also found in mammalian targeting subunits (RGl/GM, GL, PTG and R5) and several starch-binding proteins including glucoamylase (Bork et al. 1998; Wu et al. 1998). Protein fragments from RGl/GM and GL subunits containing this domain are able to target GST fusion proteins to glycogen polymers (Armstrong et al. 1998; Wu et al. 1998).

The motif II Gac1p1±169 inhibited Glc7p activity towards phosphormutant contained alanine substitutions N356A and ylase a (Fig. 8), while it had very little eect on the Y357A. N356 in Gac1p corresponds to N228 in GM, which phosphatase activity of the mutant protein Glc7(R73C), is critical for binding of GM to glycogen synthase (Liu which has been shown to interact poorly with Gac1p and Brautigan 2000). The motif III mutant contained (Stuart et al. 1994). These results indicate that the inhialanine substitutions in ®ve conserved residues of Gac1p bition is caused by the binding of Gac1p1±169 to Glc7p.

In contrast,

Cultures of representative transformants were serially diluted onto selective medium (-Trp-Leu) (left panel) or onto -His medium containing 100 mM 3AT (right panel) to screen for interaction between Gsy2p and Gac1p. The two-hybrid interaction was also assayed by measuring the level of bgalactosidase activity in the transformants

Evidence for competition between Glc7p regulatory subunits in vivo The existence of the VXF motif in many PP1 regulatory subunits suggests that dierent subunits may compete for binding to PP1. Indeed, this has been demonstrated in vitro, where the muscle or liver glycogen PP1 holoenzyme can be inhibited by peptides derived from the PP1-binding domains of other subunits (Eglo et al. 1997), but no in vivo evidence has been reported. If there is competition for binding, overexpression of one regulatory subunit may disrupt a physiological process controlled by a PP1 holoenzyme containing another regulatory subunit. We tested this possibility in our system by assaying glucose repression in strains overexpressing Gac1p. Glucose repression requires the Glc7p-binding protein Reg1p and can be assayed easily by measuring invertase activity in yeast strains grown in medium containing high concentrations of glucose (repressing conditions). Wild-type cells express low levels of invertase under these conditions, but reg1 mutants and

631 Table 4, invertase activity is increased in strains expressing high levels of Gac1p peptides that contain the Glc7p-binding domain, but not in strains overexpressing Gac1p130±502, which lacks the Glc7p-binding domain. Expression of Gac1p1±502 results in the highest level of invertase under repressing conditions. If the increase in invertase expression is caused by competition between Gac1p and Reg1p, then a reduction in the strength of the Gac1p-Glc7p interaction should reduce the competition. We tested this hypothesis in two ways. First, we repeated the experiment in a glc7-1 strain, which encodes a mutant Glc7p with reduced anity for Gac1p (Stuart et al. 1994). As shown in Table 4, invertase levels in glc7-1 strains expressing Gac1p1±502 and Gac1p1±368 are signi®cantly reduced from that of the wild-type GLC7 strain. Second, we expressed pG1-Gac1p-F73A in KT1100 and found no evidence for glucose derepression (data not shown). If the glucose-derepressed phenotype we observed in strains expressing high levels of Gac1p is due to competition between subunits, then co-expression of Reg1p from a high-copy-number plasmid may restore glucose repression to Gac1p expressing strains. This appears to be the case. As shown in Table 4, strain KT1357 expressing pG1-Gac1p1±502 and YEp-Reg1p exhibits lower levels of invertase expression than the same strain expressing pG1-Gac1p1±502 and the vector YEp13. The competition we observed could be speci®c for Gac1p and Reg1p or it could apply to other subunits as

glc7 mutants whose products fail to interact with Reg1p well. glc7-109 strains are uniquely sensitive to 0.9 M are derepressed for invertase expression (Tu and Carlson NaCl (Baker et al. 1997; Venturi et al. 2000). We have 1994, 1995). Like Gac1p, Reg1p contains an I-X-F motif recently found that glc7-109 mutants are sensitive to a that is necessary for activity in vivo (Alms et al. 1999; wide range of ions, including Li+, Na+, Cs+, and Dombek et al. 1999). If Gac1p and Reg1p compete for Mn2+ (Williams-Hart, Wu, and Tatchell, manuscript in Glc7p, we would expect that high concentrations of preparation). Because glc7-109 mutants are not defective Gac1p would derepress invertase expression in cells in other physiological pathways, the ion sensitivity of grown on high concentrations of glucose. As shown in this mutant could be due to a speci®c defect in binding Table 4 Overexpression of Gac1p causes glucose derepression
