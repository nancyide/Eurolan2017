Abstract. KARl has been identified as an essential gene which is involved in karyogamy of mating yeast cells and in spindle pole body duplication of mitotic ceils (Rose, M. D., and G. R. Fink. 1987. Cell. 48:1047-1060). We investigated the cell cycledependent localization of the Karl protein (Karlp) and its interaction with other SPB components. Karlp is associated with the spindle pole body during the entire cell cycle of yeast. Immunoelectron microscopic studies with anti-Karlp antibodies or with the monoclonal antibody 12CA5 using an epitope-tagged, functional Karlp revealed that Karlp is associated with the half bridge or the bridge of the spindle pole body. Cdc3 lp, a Ca2+-binding protein, was previously identified as the first component of the half bridge of the spindle pole body (Spang, A., I. Courtney, U. Fackler, M. Matzner, and E. Schiebel. 1993. J. Cell Biol. 123:405-416). Using an in vitro assay we demonstrate that Cdc31p specifically interacts with a short sequence within the carboxy terminal half of Karlp. The potential Cdc31p-binding sequence of Karlp contains three acidic amino acids which are not found in calmodulin-binding peptides, explaining the different substrate specificities of Cdc3 lp and calmodulin. Cdc31p was also able to bind to the carboxy terminus of Nufip/Spc110p, another component of the SPB (Kilmartin, J. V., S. L. Dyos, D. Kershaw, and J. T. Finch. 1993. J. Cell Biol. 123:1175-1184). The association of Karlp with the spindle pole body was independent of Cdc31p. Cdc31p, on the other hand, was not associated with SPBs of karl cells.

HE direction, number and polarity of microtubules of an eukaryotic cell is organized by microtubule organizing centers (MTOC)~. The most prominent

MTOC is the centrosome of highereukaryotes. The spindle pole body (SPB) is the homologue of the centrosome in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The SPB is a cylindrical multilaminated organelle which is embedded in the nuclear envelope (Byers and Goetsch, 1975). A number of substructures of the SPB are detectable by electron microscopy (see Fig. 9 A). The central plaque is in contact with the nuclear envelope. Inner and outer plaques function as nucleation sites for the nuclear and cytoplasmic microtubules, respectively (Byers and Goetsch, 1975; Byers, 1981a,b). The central plaque is disrupted by the less electron dense central line (Spang et al., 1993). An additional substructure of the SPB, the intermediate line, is located between the outer and central plaque (Rout and Kilmartin, 1990). The half bridge appears in the electron microscope as a darkly stained strip This paper is dedicated to Dr. lain Courtney who died in July 1994.

along the cytoplasmic margin of the nuclear envelopeon one side of the SPB (Byers and Goetsch, 1975; Byers, 1981a,b). The half bridge is notjust a specialized section ofthe nuclear envelope, because it remains associated with enriched SPBs after the nuclear envelope is dissolvedwith detergent (Spang et al., 1993). The SPB duplicates just once during the cell cycleof Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In early G~, a structure called the satellite forms on the cytoplasmic face of the half bridge. After START of the cell cycle two SPBs can be observed side by side in the nuclear envelope. The duplicated SPBs are connected via the two half bridges, now called the bridge. At a later stage, the bridge is severed and the two separated SPBs form the poles of the mitotic spindle. Several components ofthe SPB have been identified. Spindle or SPB components with molecular mass of 110,90, and 80 kD were identified by raising monoclonal antibodies against an enriched fraction of SPBs (Rout and Kilmartin, 1990). The gene coding for the ll0-kD SPB component was cloned independently by three different approaches (Mirzayan et al., 1992; Geiser et al., 1993; Kilmartin et al., 1993). The ll0-kD SPB component (also called Nufip and Spcll0p) has a predicted coiled-coil structure and regulates the spacing between the central and inner plaque of the SPB (Kilmartin et al., 1993). The COOH terminus of Nuflp/Spcll0p interacts in a Ca2+-dependent manner with calmodulin (CAM), another component of the SPB (Sun et March

al., 1992; Geiser et al., 1993). The 90-kD component is associated with the outer and inner plaque of the SPB (Rout and Kilmartin, 1990). The 80-kD protein is bound to nuclear microtubules, particularly those close to the SPB (Rout and Kilmartin, 1990). Cdc31p-an essential Ca2+-binding protein-was identified as the first component of a SPB substructure, the half bridge (Baum et al., 1986; Spang et al., 1993). KAR/was originally identified by its role in karyogamy (Conde and Fink, 1976). Subsequent studies revealed its additional function in SPB duplication (Rose and Fink, 1987). These functions are mediated by two separate domains of Karlp. The NH2-terminal section of Karlp seems to function in karyogamy, while the COOH terminus of Karlp is required for SPB duplication (Vallen et al., 1992a,b). The localization of wild-type Karlp was never determined. However, because overexpressed Karlp-/3-galactosidase hybrid proteins localized to the SPB, it has been proposed that Karlp is a component of the SPB. One hybrid protein lacking the essential COOH terminus was localized by immunoelectron microscopy to the outer plaque of the SPB (Vallen et al., 1992b). In addition, this Karlp-/3-galactosidase hybrid protein was associated with the SPB in a cell cycle-dependent manner. After SPB duplication, the hybrid protein was associated with only one of the two SPBs, usually the one that entered the bud (Vallen et al., 1992b). Recently, it was suggested that the localization of the Karlp-/3galactosidase proteins may not be identical at all stages with the localizationofwild-typeKarlp (Biggins and Rose, 1994). In this study we investigatedthe subcellular localization of wild-type Karlp and the interaction of Cdc31p with Karlp. Table I. Yeast Strains

Karlp is located to the SPB during the entire cell cycle of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition, Karlp is associated with isolated SPBs and is a component of the half bridge or bridge of the SPB. Therefore, Karlp and Cdc3lp localize to the same substructure of the SPB. The association of Karlp with the SPB was independent of Cdc3lp. On the other hand, no Cdc3lp was detected at the SPB in cells lacking Karlp. Both SPB components interact in vitro. Analysis of the sequence of Karlp which is responsible for Cdc3 lp binding suggests that Cdc31p and CaM have different binding requirements. Materials and Methods YeastStrains, Media, Bacterial and Yeast Transformation Table I summarizes the yeast strains that were used in this study. The stan¢lard medium for growth of yeast was yeast extract, peptone, dextrose growth medium (YPD). Synthetic minimal (SM) medium and synthetic complete (SC) medium were prepared as described by Guthrie and Fink (1991). E. coli strains were transformed by electroporation (Dower et al., 1988). Yeast ceils were transformed using the lithium acetate method (Schiestl and Gietz, 1989). DNA Techniques DNA fragments were isolated from agarose gels with the Genclean II kit from Bio 101 (La Jolla, CA). PCR was performed with Vent polymerase supplied by New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, Germany). The nuclcotide sequence of all PCR constructs was determined by the chain-termination method of Sanger et al. (1977). All other DNA manipulations were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (1989).

Construction ofGST-KARI and GST-NUF1/SPCIIO Gene Fusions, Construction ofan Epitope-Tagged KARl, Construction of a CDM1 Expression Plasmid

GST-KARLThe KAR/gene of plasmid pMR76 (Rose and Fink, 1987) was amplified by PCR with the primers KARl-Barn (5'-CCGTGCJGATCCATGTAACTTCTCCAAA-3') and KARl-IV 5'-CGTAATCTGGAACGTCATATG-3'). The PCR product was restricted with BamHl and EcoRl and subcloned into the multiple cloning site of plasmid pGEX-3X (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Piscataway, NJ) resulting in a gene fusion of glutathione-Stransferase (GST) and KAR/(GST-KAR/). The plasmid was named pSM9. GST-AKAR/:Plasmid pSM9 was restricted with Baml-IIand HindlI. The 1,158-bpfragment wasisolatedandcloned intotheBamHl, SmaIrestriction sites of vector pGEX-3X. The recombinant plasmid generated was named pSM95. GST-AKarlpcontained the NH2 terminus (amino acids 1 to 386) of Karlp fused to the COOH terminus of GST. GST-AAKAR/:pSM9 was restricted with BamHI and XmnI. The 702-bp fragment was cloned into pGEX-3X restricted with BamHI and SmaI. The plasmid generated was named pSM57. GST-AAKarlp contains the NH2 terminus (amino acids 1 to 237) of Karlp fused to the COOH terminus of GST. GST-AKAR/-A:The 456-bp XrnnI-Hindll fragment of KAR/was cloned into the Smal site ofvectorpGEX-5X (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The resulting plasmid was named pSM137. The GST-AKarlp-Afusion protein contains the amino acids 237 to 386 of Karlp fused to the COOH terminus of GST. GST-AKAR1-2A: Plasmid pSM137 was restricted with the enzymes NsiI and Sail. The Sall restriction site is located in the multiple cloning site of pGEX-5X and the NsiI restriction site in the coding region of KARL Blunt ends were generated with T4 DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany). The vector was religated to give plasmid pSM148. GST-AKarlp-2Acontains amino acids 237 to 350 fusedto theCOOH terminus of GST. GST-AKARI-3A: Plasmid pSM137was restricted with the restriction enzymes BsmI and Sail. BsmI is located in the open reading frame of KARL The 3' and 5' ends were converted to blunt ends with T4 DNA polymerase. The vector was then religated to give plasmid pSM147. GST-AKarlp-3A contains amino acids 237 to 272 fused with the COOH terminus of GST. GST-AKARI-4A: Plasmid pSM137 was restricted with the restriction enzyme XhoI. The linearized fragment was partially restricted with the enzyme RcaI. The ends were blunted with 1"4polymerase and then religated. The construction was confirmed by sequencing. GST-AKarlp-4Acontains amino acids 237 to 255 fused with the COOH terminus of GST. KARl-HA: A NotI restriction site was constructed by PCR at the 3' end of the KAR/geneusing primers KARl-VIII(5'-GAACTGCGC~CGCTAAACCTATAATACACATA-3')and KARl-IX (5'-GAACTC_~GGCCGCTAAACCATATAAAGGTTAG-3'). The ll4-bp Not/fragmentofplasmid GTEP-I (waskindly providedbyDr. Futcher, Cold Spring Harbor Lab., Cold Spring Harbor, NY) carrying three repeats which code for the hemagglutinin epitope (YPYDVPDYA)was inserted into the NotI restriction site at the 3' end ofKAR/. KARl-HA was cloned into pRS316 (Sikorski and Hieter, 1989)to give plasmid pBM12. GS'I:N-NUFI: The 5' end of NUF1/SPC110(Mirzayan et al., 1992) was cloned by PCR using primers NUFI-I (5'-CGTGGGATCCACGAAC,'CGTCACATCTC-3')and NUFI-2 (5'-ITrC'IVJAATTCT'VIV~T'VIV_ATGC-33and chromosomal DNA from yeast strain $288C as a template. The DNA fragment was restricted with BamHI and EcoRI and cloned the BamHI-EcoRl sites of vector pGEX-3X. The plasmid was named pSM72. GST-N-Nuflp contains amino acids 2 to 175 of Nuflp/Spcll0p fused to the COOH terminus of GST. GST-C-NUbI: The 3' end of NUFI was cloned by PCR using primers NUF1-3 (5'-GCTGGGATCCAGAGGCGTAAAGACAATG-3')and NUF1-4 (5'-CGTGGGATCCGAAG'I'IV_.AAAGAACTCC-3').Chromosomal DNA from strain $288C was used as a template. The PCR product was restricted with Baml-IIand cloned into the BmHI site of vector pGEX-3X to give plasmid pSM74. GST-C-NuIIpcontains amino acids 793-945 fused to the COOH terminus of GST. This region of Nuflp/Spcll0p carries the CaM binding site (amino acids 900 to 927, Geiser et al., 1993). CDM1 was amplified by PCR with the primers CAM-1 (5'-CGTGTACTGTGATATGA-3') and CAM-2 (5'-GTTATCCGCCTTGGTAA-3') using chromosomal DNA from strain $288C as a template. The PCR product was cloned into pUC18 with the Sure done kit (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany). The resulting plasmid was named pSM61. The coding region of CDMI was then amplified by PCR with primers CAM-3(5'-CCACGCATATGTCCTCCAATCTTAC-3') and universe (5'-GTAAAACGACGC~CAGT-3'). Primer universe is complementary to a sequence in the multiple

cloning site of pUCI8. The sense primer (CAM-3)was designed such that the translation initiation codon (ATG)of CDM1 formed part of an NdeI restriction site. The PCR product was subeloned into the NdeI and PstI restriction sites oftbe expression vector pTT-7(Tabor and Richardson, 1985) which generated a recombinant plasmid, named pSM71. Plasmid pSM71 expressed CaM under control of the T7 promoter.

Strain Constructions

UFM2 (KARI/Akarl::HIS3). KAR/ was disrupted by the one-step gene replacement of Rothstein (1983). A 2,630-bp HindlII-EcoRI fragment of pMR76 (Rose and Fink, 1987)carrying the KAR/gene was cloned into the HindlII-EcoRl sites of vector pBluescript SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The generated recombinantplasmid wasnamed pSMI1.A 882-bp NsiI fragment located in the coding region of KAR/was substituted with the HIS3 gene on a 1,157-bp PstI fragment. The resulting plasmid pUF4 was restricted with SacI and SalI; the fragments were transformed into the diploid yeast strain YPH501 (Sikorski and Hieter, 1989), selection being made on SC Media plates lacking histidine. The construction oftbe UFM2 strain was confirmed by Southern analysis. Chromosomal DNA from His+ transformants (UFM2) and the parental strain (YPH501) was isolated and digested with restriction endonuclease HindlII and EcoRI. The fragments of DNA were separated on an agarose gel and transferred to a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Buehler, Braunschweig, Germany) by vacuum blotting. The BgllI-SaclI fragment of pSMll (which carries the entire KAR/coding region) waslabeled with digoxigeninand used as a probein Southern analysis. Preparation of labeled probe, hybridization, and detection were performed with a kit from Boehringer Mannheim. One fragment which was 2,630-bp in length wasdetected with DNA from YPH501using the KAR/probe. With UFM2, twoadditional fragmentswere detected with 1,560-and 1,150-bpindicating that one chromosomal copy of KAR/was substituted by the HIS3 gene (data not shown). ESM29andESM32. UFM2 was transformed withplasmids pSM30 (carries the 2,630-bp HindlII-EcoRI KAR/-fragmentof pMR76 in pRS316) or pBMI2 (KARl-HA in pRS316) selection being made on SC Medium plates lacking uracil. The transformants were named ESM29 and ESM32, respeCtively. ESM33and ESM36. ESM29 and ESM32 weresporulated, and the spores from 20 tetrads were analyzed. Cells derived from spores of ESM29 and ESM32 were His+, Urn÷, indicating that KAR/on pSM30 and KARl-HA on pBM12 were functional. His+, Ura- colonies were never obtained. Haploid colonies which were His+, Ura+ from the sporulation of ESM29. and ESM32 were named ESM33 (Akarl::HlS3 [pSM30]) and ESM36 (Akarl::HIS3 [pBMI2]), respectively. ESM29 and ESM32 were unable to growon 5-fluorooroticacid (5-FOA)plates suggestingthat plasmids pSM30 and pBM12 were essential for the viability in these strains. ESMll5. The KAR/genewasamplified by PCR with primers KAR1-Nde (5'-ACGGACATATGAATGTAACTTCTCCAA-3')and KARl-IV (5'-CGTAATCTGGAACGTCATATG-3'). Primer KAR1-Nde is complementary to the 5' end of the KAR/ coding region. The 1,640-bp PCR fragment was treated with the Sure clone kit from Pharmacia (Freiburg, Germany) and ligatedinto the EcoRVsiteofplasrnidpriAM8 (Mountainet al., 1991).Plasmid priAM8 carries the MET3 promoter in pUC19. The recombinant pinsmid was named pSM45. A SalI-EcoRI DNA fragment carrying the MET3KAR/ gene fusion was then cloned into the yeast E. coli shuttle vector pRS414 (Sikorski and Hieter, 1989). The resulting plasmid was named pSM46. Plasmid pSM46 wastransformed into yeast strain ESM33 selection being made on SC Medium plates lacking uracil and tryptophan. Transformants were streaked out on SM Medium plates which were supplemented with adenine, leucine, lysine, uracil, and 5-FOA. The MET3 promoter is active in this growth medium which does not contain methionine. 5-FOA selects for cells which lost the URA3-basedplasmid pSM30 (carries KAR/ under control of its own promoter). 5-FOA resistant colonies were Uraand unable to grow on plates containing methionine indicating that the essential KAR/gene (Roseand Fink, 1987)is under control ofthe MET3promoter. This strain was named ESMll5 (Akarl::HIS3 [pSM46]). ESM34. The GST-KARIgene fusion of plasmid pSM9 was amplified by PCR using primers KAR1-B(5'-ACTCGCCGCGGTATCCACTTCGATCACTTT-3') and KARl-C (5'-GATACTGCGGCCGCTCCCCTATACTGA-3'). KAR1-Bbinds to the 3' non-coding region ofKAR/.KARl-C is complementary to the 5' end ofthe GST coding region. The PCR product was restricted with Notl and cloned into the NotI restriction site ofplasmid pSM13to give plasmid pSM25. Plasmid pSMI3 was constructed as follows. The 5' noncoding region of KARl was amplified with primers KARl-I (5'-ACGAAGGATCCTTTGAATATCAATGAAAAT-3')and KARI-II (5'-GATAC'IV_~GGCCGC'~.ATq'V_.A~AAC'IV_AAAAA-3').The PCR product was restricted

with BamHI and Notl and then cloned into the BamHI and NotI sites of the vector pRS316 (Sikorski and Hieter, 1989). Yeast strain UFM2 (KAR// Akarl::HlS3) was transformed with plasmid pSM25 selection being made on SC plates lacking uracil. Transformants were sporulated and tetrads dissected. Colonies derived from spores of UFM2 (ixgM25)which were Urn+, His+ (Akarl::HIS3 [pSM25]) were obtained with high frequency (strain ESM34).

Nuclei Isolation, SPBPreparation, Cell Fractionation, Cell Extracts

Nuclei and SPBs from yeast strain BJ5626 or ESM36 were isolated as described by Rout and Kilmartin (1990). Cells of the diploid yeast strain BJ5626 were fractionated into a cell lysate, a soluble and an insoluble fraction as described by Spang et al. (1993). Protein extracts were prepared as described by Ausubel et ai. (1994).

Isolation ofthe GST-Karlpand GST-Nuflp FusionProteins

Expression of GST-Karlp in E coil BL21 (DE3, pSMg) (Studier and Moffat, 1986) was induced by the addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl-~-Dthiogalactopyranoside (IFIG). DE3 of E. coil strain BL21 (DE3) indicates that the strain carries a lysogenic lambda phage with the T7 RNA polymerase structural gene (Studier and Moffat, 1986). The E. coli ceils were lysed after 3 h of inductionby ultrasonicationas described by Spang et al. (1993). The GST-Karlp fusionprotein formed inclusionbodies which were enriched bydifferential centrifugation. Uniysedcells were removed by low speed centrifugation (10 rain, 1,000 g, 4°C). Inclusion bodies were then collected by centrifugation (15 rain, 10,000 g, 4°C). The GST-Karlp fusion protein was further purified by preoperative SDS-PAGE (Laemmli, 1970). The separated proteinswere transferredonto nitrocelluloseand stained with Ponceau S (Serva Feinbiochemica GmbH & Co. KG, Heidelberg, Germany). Expression and purification of GST-AKarlp, GST-AAKarlp, GSTAKarlp-2A, GST-AKarlp-3A, GST-AKarlp-4A and GST-N-Nuflp in E. coli BL21 (DE3), containingthe correspondingplasmids were as recommended by Pharmacia.

PreparationofAj~inity-purifiedAnti-Karlp, Anti-N-Nuflp, Anti-~-Tubulin Antibodies

GST-Karlp containing nitrocellulose strips were dissolved with DMSO and injected into rabbitsas described by Harlow and Lane (1988). Purified antiKarlp antibodies were prepared by affinity chromotography as described by Harlow and Lane (1988). An E. coli extract containing GST was coupled to CNBr-Sepharose as recommendedby Pharmacia. The IgG fraction containing the anti-Karlp antibodies was run over the GST E. coli protein column to remove anti-GST antibodies. The preabsorbed IgG fraction was then incubated with purified GST-AKarlp coupled to CNBr-Sepharose 4B. Anti-Karlp antibodies were eluted with 100 mM glycine, pH 2.5. The pH was immediately adjusted to pH 7.5 with 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. BSA (0.1 m_g/ml)was added to the affinity-purified anti-Karlp antibodies which were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Purified GST-N-Nuflp was injected into a goat (Harlow and Lane, 1988). Purified anti-N-Nuflp antibodies were prepared as described for anti-Karlp antibodies using purified GST-N-Nuflp coupled to CNBr-Sepharose. Goat anti-~-tubulinpeptide antibodies were prepared as follows: a peptide (CMSKNRSSLQSGPLN) corresponding to the COOH-terminai amino acids of yeast/~-tubulin was coupled to BSA with m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MBS; Pierce, Rockford, IL). The coupled peptide was injected into a goat as recommended by Harlow and Lane (1988). For afffiaity-purification of the anti-/3-tubulin antibodies, the /3-tubulin peptide was coupled to epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B as recommended by Pharmacia. Anti-/~-tubulin antibodies were ehited from the peptide resin with 100 mM glycine, pH 2.5. The pH of the eluted antibodies was adjusted immediately as described for the anti-Karlp antibodies. The anti-~-tubulin antibodies were specific for/~-tubulin in immunoblots and immunofluorescence.

ImmunoelectronMicroscopy,Immunofluorescenceof Nuclei and YeastCells

Immunolectronmicroscopy of whole yeast cells and isolated SPBs was performed with affinity-purified anti-Karlp or 12CA5 antibodies (Hiss Diagnostics GmbH, Freiburg, Germany) as described by Preuss et al. (1991)

with the modifications of Spang et al. (1993). A 1:500 dilution of anti-Karlp and a 1:250dilutionof 12CA5antibodieswere used. The gold particles were visualized in a Jeol JEM 100B electron microscope (Jeol Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Immunofluorescence of yeast nuclei and yeast cells were performed as described by Spang et al. (1993) and Adams and Pringle (1984). Cells were fixed for 5 min with formaldehyde. A 1:1,000 dilution of affinity-purified anti-Karlp antibodies was used. A pool of various mouse monoclonal anti-90-kD antibodieswas a generous gift from Dr. J. Kilmartin. Secondary antibodies were goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Cy3 and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with FITC from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PAl. No signal was obtainedwhennuclei or cells were incubated either with secondary antibodies only or with preimmune serum. Similarly, no signal was obtained in double-labelingexperiments in which treatment with eitherof the primary antibodies was followed by incubation with the "mismatched" secondary antibody. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).

Immunoblotting, Protein Determination

Protein concentration of samples was determined using the method from Bradford (1976). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE as described by Laemmli (1976). Immunoblottingwas performed as described by Spang et al. (1993). Detection was made by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) usinga kit from Amersham BuchlerGmbH 0Braunschweig, Germany). The primary antibodies were rabbit anti-Cdc31p (Spang et al., 1993), rabbit anti-Karlp, goat anti-Nuflp/Spcll0p (anti-ll0-kD protein), goat anti-Etubulin and mouse anti-90-kD antibodies. In the case of the mouse monoclonal anti-90-kD antibody, incubation with the primary antibody was followed by an incubation with rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Secondary antibodies were goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio Pad, Hercules, CA) and rabbit anti-goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase.

Isolation of[3sS]Cdc31pand [3JS]CaM

E. coil strain BL21 (DE3, pLysS, pSM5) (Spang et al., 1993) or BL21 (DE3, pLysS, pSM71) were grown in TY medium (bacto trypton, yeast extract) supplemented with 100 #g/rni ampicillin to mid-log phase. Plasmid pSM5 (Spang et al., 1993) and pSM71 contain CDC31 and CDMI, respectively, under the control of the inducible phage T7 promoter (Tabor and Richardson, 1985). Plasmid pLysS carries the T'/lysozyme gene. T7 lysozyme inhibitsresidual amounts ofthe T7 RNA polymerase before induction with IPTG (Studier and Moffat, 1986). The E. coil cells were washed three times with M9 minimal medium and then incubated for 1 h at 37°C. IPTG (0.5 mM) was added to the cultures to induce the T7-RNA polymerase. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Finally, rifampicin (200 #g/ml) was added to inhibit the E. coil RNA polymerase. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Cdc31p and CaM were selectively labeled by the addition of 10 #Ci/ml [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Tran35S-label; DuPont, Bad Homburg, Germany) for 5 min at 37°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (3 rain, 14,000 g, 4°C). The cell sediment was resuspended in 1/10 vol 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSE 100 ~g/ml lysozyme. The cells were lysed by three freeze-thawing cycles. Unlysed ceils were removed by centrifugation (14,000 g, 4°C, 15 rain). Cdc31p and CaM were then enriched by heating the cell extract for 5 rain at 80°C. Denatured proteins were removed by centrifugation (14,000 g, 4°C, 15 min). 90% of Cdc31p and CaM was in the supernatant. The enriched Cdc31p and CaM were radiochemically pure. The chemical purity of Cdc31p and CaM was ·80% as estimated by SDS-PAGE.

Interaction ofCdc31pand CaM with Karlp and Nuflp/Spc110p

E. coli extracts containing GST-Karlp, GST-AKarlp, GST-AAKarlp, GSTN-Nuflp and GST-C-Nuflp were separated by SDS-PAGE. The extracts were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting using a semi-dry transfer cell from Bio Pad. Protein binding sites were blocked with 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCI, 5% BSA, 0.05% Tween for 2 h at 20°C. Membranes were then incubated either with buffer A (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCI, 0.05% Tween, 0.1% BSA, 0.1% gelatine, 1 mM CaCl2) or buffer B (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween, 0.1% BSA, 0.1% gelatine, 10 mM EGTA)for 1 h at 20°C.

cubated with buffer A or B for 1 h at 4°C. The preincubated Cdc31p and CaM were incubated with the nitrocellulose membranes in buffer A or B for 2 h at 20°C. To remove unbound Cdc31p and CaM, the membranes were washed four times with buffer A or B, respectively, for 20 rain at 20°C. The dried membranes were autoradiographed using a X-ornat AR film from Kodak.

Dot Blot OverlayAssay

GST-AKarlp, GST-AKarlp-A, GST-AKarlp-2A, GST-AKarlp-3&, GSTAKarlp-4A, and GST were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified as described. 50 pmol of the various GST fusion proteins were immobilized onto nitrocellulose membranes using a dot blot apparatus from Schleicher and Schuell (Dassel, Germany). The membrane was incubated with [3sS]Cdc31p in buffer A for 2 h at 20°C. The membrane was washed four times with buffer A for 20 min at 20°C. Sections of nitrocellulose membranes containing the fusion proteins and bound [35S]Cdc31p were cut out. The radioactivity was determined by a liquid scintillation counter (LSI801; Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). One sample did not contain any protein. The radioactivity bound to this sample was considered as nonspecific binding. The other samples were corrected for the non-specific binding. All experiments were performed in triplicates.

Synchronization of YeastCells UsingStrain Y255

Strain Y255 carries the cdc28-4 allele and in addition clnl::HlSG and cln2A. The CLN1and CLN3 genes are under control of the GAL/promoter (GALI::CLN1on plasmid p215(LEU2) and GALI::CLN3in the CLN3 locus) (T. Schuster, unpublished observation). Y255 was grown in SC Medium containing 2% ratiinose and 1% galactose to mid log phase. The cells were washed twice with water and resuspended in SC medium with 2% raffinose. After 4 h in SC raflinose medium >95 % of the cells were arrested at START. The cells continued synchronously in the cell cycle after the addition of 2 % galactose to the SC raftinose medium.

FigureL The affinity-purifiedanti-Karlp antibodies are specific. Total yeast extracts were prepared as described in Materials and Methodsfromyeast strains BJ5626(KARLlane 1), ESM33 (KAR/, lane 2), ESM36 (KARl-HA,lane 3), MS2083 (karl-AfT,lane 4) and ESM34 (GST-KAR/,lane 5). Proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGEand transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with affinity-purifiedanti-Karlp antibodies. The immunoblot was developed with an ECL kit from Amersham.

Results Karlp Is Associated with the SPB During the Entire Cell Cycleof YeastSaccharomycescerevisiae. The yeast KAR/ is an essential gene which is required for SPB duplication and nuclear fusion (Rose and Fink, 1987; Conde and Fink, 1976). Despite its importance, the cellular distribution of wild-type Karlp has not been established. For this reason, we investigated the localization of wild-type Karlp with affinity-purified anti-Karlp antibodies using immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. The specificity of the antibody-antigen interaction was critical for the success of these experiments. Affinitypurified anti-Karlp antibodies were prepared as described in Materials and Methods. In a total yeast extract of strains BJ5626 and ESM33 expressing wild-type Karlp, only one protein was recognized by the affinity-purifiedanti-Karlp antibodies (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2). This protein had a molecular mass of 53 kD which is the predicted MW of Karlp (Rose and Fink, 1987). The Karlp-HA and GST-Karlp fusion proteins of strains ESM36 (lane 3) and ESM34 (lane 5) should have molecular masses of 56 and 79 kD, respectively. In agreement with this prediction, proteins with these molecular masses were detected from extracts of ESM36 and ESM34. A small amount of Karlp was detected in some preparations extracted from ESM36 which probably reflects proteolyticdegradation of Karlp-HA during sample preparation. Strain MS2083 carries the karl-Al7 mutation (Vallen et al., 1992b; 1994). As expected for this deletion, the antiKarlp antibodies detected a 49-kD protein in extracts of MS2083 (lane 4). These results demonstrate that our antiKarlp antibodies are highly specific for Karlp and suitable

for localization studies by indirect immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. The localization of Karlp in yeast strain BJ5626 was investigated by indirect immunofluorescence. Double-labeling experiments were performed with afffinity-purified anti-Karlp and anti-90-kD antibodies. The monoclonal anti-90-kD antibodies were used as markers for SPBs (Rout and Kilmartin, 1990). DNA was stained with DAPI. As expected for SPB components, the Karlp and the 90-kD proteins were detected as one or two dots at the nuclear periphery (Fig. 2 A, compare anti-Karlp and anti-90-kD with DAPI). No defined Karlp staining was observed in other parts of the cell. To confirm the nuclear localization of Karlp, the immunofluorescence experiment was repeated with isolated nuclei (Fig. 2 B). In agreement with the immunofluorescence of yeast cells, the signal obtained with the anti-Karlp and anti-90-kD antibodies appeared as one or two dots at the nuclear periphery (Fig. 2 B, compare anti-Karlp and anti-90-kD with DAPI staining). In 98 % of the cases (n = 1000), the Karlp and 90-kD signals coincided, indicating an association of Karlp with the SPB. In ,o1% a double spot of anti-Karlp or anti-90-kD gives a single signal with the other antibody. In the remaining 1% a SPB staining was only obtained with either the anti-90-kD or the anti-Karlp antibodies. The Karlp-/3-galactosidase hybrid proteins showed a typical cell cycle-dependentbehavior (Vallen et al., 1992b). After SPB duplication, the hybrid proteins were found in association with only one of the two SPBs, usually that SPB which enters the bud (Vallen et al., 1992b). We investigated whether wild-type Karlp is also associated with the SPB in a cell cycle-dependent manner. At first, the percentage of SPBs of monopolar, short and long spindles, which were detected by the anti-Karlp and anti-90-kD antibodies, were determined (Table II). Most (>95%) of the SPBs were costained by the anti-Karlp and anti-90-kD antibodies independent of the cell cycle stage of the yeast cells. In a few cells no colocalization was observed (Table II). Second, we synchronized yeast cultures and determined the distribution Downloaded

of Karlp by indirect immunofluorescence. To exclude possible artifacts, yeast cells were synchronized by two different methods, using either a cdc15mutant or strain Y255. Since both approaches yielded the same result, only the data obtained with the cdc15cells are shown (Fig. 3). Ceils of cdcl5 arrest uniformly at the non-permissive temperature in mitosis with duplicated SPB and a long mitotic spindle (Fig. 3, 0 min).

An early logarithmic growing culture of yeast strain BJ5626 was prepared for immunofluorescence as described in Materials and Methods and stained with anti-Karlp and anti-90-kD antibodies.

antibodies at this stage of the cell cycle. Cells of cdcl5 were then shifted to permissive conditions, whereupon the cells continued in the cell cycle. After the release of the cell cycle block, samples were taken every 30 min and the localization of Karlp was determined by indirect immunofluorescence. Karlp was associated with the SPB in yeast cells with no buds (Fig. 3, Gl phase of the cell cycle, 30 min after the temperature shift), small- (S-phase, 60 min), medium- (G:, 90 min), and large-budded cells (mitosis, 120 rain). These results strongly suggest that Karlp is a constitutive component of the yeast SPB. Karlp Is a Component of the Half Bridge of the SPB To understand the function of SPB components and the structure of the SPB, it is important to determine the association of SPB components with substructures of this organelle. At least nine structures of the SPB are detectable by electron microscopy-outer, inner, and central plaque, intermediate and central line, cytoplasmic and nuclear side of the half bridge and bridge, satellite, and connecting fibers between the inner and central plaque. Despite its importance, the sublocalization of only three SPB components- Nuflp/Spc110p, 90-kD component, and Cdc3 lp-have been determined by immunoelectron microscopy (Rout and Kilmartin, 1990; Kilmartin et al., 1993; Spang et al., 1993). We first studied the localization of Karlp by immunoelectron microscopy using isolated SPBs. Enriched fractions of SPBs contain about 500x more SPBs per volume in comparison to whole yeast cells, making it much easier to obtain

Figure 3. Karlp is associated with the SPB during the entire cell cycle. Strain Y49 (cdc15-1) was grown in YPD at 23°C to mid-log phase. The culture was then shifted to 37°C until >90% of the ceils were arrested as large-budded cells. The arrested cells continued in the cell cycleafterdecreasing the incubation temperature to 23°C (t = 0).

However, it was important to establish that the SPB component of interest does not disassemble from the SPB during the enrichment procedure. Therefore, we tested whether Karlp cofractionates with enriched preparations of SPBs. Equal amounts of total protein from a cell lysate, 100,000 g supernatant and sediment fractions, isolated nuclei, sucrose and Pereoll gradient-enriched SPBs were separated by SDS-PAGE. The distribution of three SPB components, Cdc31p (Fig. 4 A), Nuflp/Spcll0p (Fig. 4 B), and 90-kD SPB component (Fig. 4 C) was determined as markers for the enrichment of SPBs. In addition, ~tubulin (Fig. 4 D) and two nucleolar proteins, Noplp and Nop2p (Jansen et al., 1993) (Fig. 4 F), were also detected by immunoblotting. As we expected, the SPB components Nuflp/Spcll0p, 90-kD protein and Cdc31p were most strongly enriched in the frac-

tions containing most of the SPBs (sucrose and Percoll gradient purified SPBs). The amount of tubulin decreased at first with the enrichment of nuclei. This is in agreement with the observation that purified nuclei contain almost no microtubules, since most microtubules were lost during the isolation of the nuclei (Spang et al., 1993). Tubulin was strongly enriched with the SPBs from the sucrose gradient, as expected for a SPB-associated component, then partially separated from SPBs from the Percoll gradient. This reflects a decrease in length of the microtubules associated with the SPBs from the sucrose in comparison to the SPBs of the Percoil gradient (data not shown). Noplp and Nop2p were most strongly enriched with isolated nuclei, as expected for proteins of the nucleolus. The concentration of these proteins subsequently decreased with increasing purity of the SPBs, indicating a specific enrichment of SPBs. Karlp was progres-

sively enriched with increasing purity of the SPBs and behaved very like the SPB components Cdc3 lp, Nuflp/Spc110p and 90-kD protein. We conclude from this result that Karlp cofractionates with purified preparations of SPBs. The localization of Karlp was investigated by immunoelectron microscopy with ultra-thin sections of enriched SPBs using affinity-purified anti-Karlp antibodies. The substructures of the SPB-outer, central, and inner plaque and half bridge or bridge-were clearly detectable (Fig. 5, A-E). No cytoplasmic or nuclear microtubules were associated with the SPBs in this preparation. Two to six gold particles were associated with an electron dense structure-the half bridge-next to the central plaque (Fig. 5, A-Cand E). After START of the cell cycle, the SPB duplicates and the two SPBs are still connected by the bridge. The bridge appeared in electron micrographs as an electron dense layer connect-

ing the central plaques of the mother and daughter SPB (Fig. 5 D). Gold particles were localized with the cytoplasmic side of the bridge (Fig. 5 D). Only ,o10% of the isolated SPBs were labeled by the anti-Karlp antibodies. In these cases, the half bridge or bridge was stained. No staining of other structures was observed. One possible explanation for the poor efficiencyof the SPB staining by the anti-Karlp antibodies is the fixation-sensitivity of Karlp epitopes. In agreement with this conclusion, we observed that the percentage of SPBs stained by immunofluorescence of yeast cells strongly decreased with increasing fixation time (data not shown). To confirm the association of Karlp with the half bridge, we repeated the immunoelectron microscopy with an epitope-tagged Karlp-HA protein. A gene fusion consisting of KAR/and three sequences coding for the hemagglutinine epitope (YPYDVPDYA) was constructed. The plasmid coding for KARl-HA (pBM12) was transformed into the yeast strain UFM2 (KAR1/Akarl::HIS3). The strain UFM2 (pBM12) was sporulated, and the viability of 20 tetrads was determined. Colonies from spores which were haploid, His+ and Ura÷ were obtained, indicating that these strains carried the Akarl::HIS3 disruption and the URA3-based plasmid pBM12. This strain was designated ESM36. Since KAR/is essential for viability (Rose and Fink, 1987) and the chromosomal KAR/gene of ESM36 is disrupted, KARI-HA on plasmid pBM12 must provide KAR/function. Immunoblotting of cell extracts of ESM36 with anti-Karlp (Fig. 1, lane 3) and 12CA5 (data not shown) antibodies revealed the Karlp-HA fusion protein with the expected molecular mass of ,,o58 kD. In a wild-type control (YPH499), however, Karlp (molecular mass of 53 kD) was detected with the antiKarlp but not the 12CA5 antibodies. In addition, we obtained SPB staining by indirect immunofluorescenceusing ESM36 cells and 12CA5 antibodies. A wild-type strain did not show any signal with 12CA5 antibodies (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that the Karlp-HA fusion protein is expressed in ESM36 cells, provides Karlp function, and localizes with the SPB. We enriched SPBs from ESM36 cells and determined the localization of Karlp-HA by immunoelectron microscopy using 12CA5 antibodies (Fig. 5, F-l). In this experiment, the embedded and sectioned SPBs still contained microtubules. More than 50% of the SPBs were labeled by the 12CA5 antibodies. The gold particles were again associated with the half bridge, confirming our results with the anti-Karlp antibodies. SPBs from a wild-type strain were not stained with the 12CA5 antibodies (data not shown). To confirm the localization of Karlp-HA in whole yeast cells, sections of cells of ESM36 were labeled with 12CA5 antibodies (Fig. 5, J-L). The SPBs were sectioned so that the central plaque of the SPB is clearly visible in a discontinuity of the nuclear envelope. Also visible in the micrograph is the half bridge as an electron-dense extension of the central plaque of the nuclear envelope. The outer and inner plaques were not detected by the procedure used for immunoelectron microscopy. Most of the yeast cells contained one or two gold particles randomly distributed throughout the cell. Clusters of two to three gold particles were observed in only about 1% of the cells. In these cases, the gold particles were always next to the central plaque, at the half bridge of the SPB. The gold particles were directed toward the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope (Fig. 5, J-L) suggesting that Karlp is associated with the cytoplasmic side of the half bridge. Cdc31p Interacts with Karlp and Nuflp/SpcllOp Mutants of kar/(Rose and Fink, 1987) and cdc31 (Byers, 1981a,b) have similar phenotypes; they arrest as large budded cells with a single, enlarged SPB lacking a satellite. This finding suggests that the two proteins act along the same pathway in SPB duplication, and may even interact. However, a direct interaction between Cdc3lp and Karlp seemed unlikely, since the two proteins have been localized to different substructures of the SPB (Vallen et al., 1992b; Spang et al., 1993). Our current studies, which indicate that Karlp and Cdc31p are associated with the half bridge of the SPB, modify this picture. Cdc31p shows a striking homology to CaM (Baum et al., 1986). The interaction of CaM with other proteins was investigated by the so-called overlay assay (Glenney and Weber, 1980). Radiolabeled CaM was incubated with filterimmobilized proteins. The interaction was then assayed by autoradiography. To identify proteins which interact with Cdc31p, we performed an overlay assay with [35S]Cdc31p. Cdc31p was selectively labeled by the T7 system (Tabor and Richardson, 1985), then purified as described in Materials and Methods. [3~S]Cdc31pwas incubated with proteins from a total yeast extract and isolated nuclei (Fig. 6 A). One protein interacting with [35S]Cdc31p had a molecular mass of 53 kD; suggesting that it might be Karlp. To test whether [35S]Cdc31p binds to recombinant Karlp, we expressed GST-KAR/andtruncations of GST-KAR/inE. coli. Recently, it was reported that CaM binds to the COOH terminus of Nuflp/Spe110p (Geiser et al., 1993). To test whether Cdc31p interacts with Nuflp/Spcll0p, we also expressed the NH2and COOH-terminal part of Nuflp/Spcll0p as fusion proteins with GST in E. coli (GST-N-NUF1 and GST-C-NUF1). Fig. 6 B shows a Coomassie blue stained gel of the E. coli extracts containing the GST-Karlp and GST-Nuflp fusion proteins. E. coli extracts with the various GST-Karlp and GSTNuflp fusion proteins (Fig. 6 B) were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Fig. 6, C and D). After blocking the protein binding sites of the membranes, the blots were incubated with [35S]Cdc31p (Fig. 6 C) or [35S]CaM (Fig. 6 D) in the presence (+Ca2÷) and absence (+EGTA) of Ca2+. CaM from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used in parallel to Cdc3 lp as a control. Free Ca2+was removed by the chelator EGTA in one part of the experiment to determine whether the binding specificity of Cdc31p and CaM is Ca2+dependent. Cdc31p bound to GST-Karlp and GST-AKarlp but not to GST-AAKarlp (a truncation of the COOHterminal half of Karlp) in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 6 C, +Ca2+). In addition, an interaction was detected with the C-terminal (GST-C-Nuflp), but not the NH2-terminal, part of Nuflp/Spcll0p (GST-N-Nuflp). CaM specifically interacted with the COOH-terminal part of Nuflp/Spcll0p in the presence of Ca:+ but interacted neither with the NH2terminal part of Nuflp/Spcll0p nor with the different GSTKarlp constructs (Fig. 6 D, +Ca2÷). As previously described (Geiser et al., 1993), the interaction of CaM with GST-C-Nuflp was not observed in the absence of Ca2÷(Fig. 6 D, +EGTA). Cdc3 lp bound to more proteins in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 6 C, +EGTA). The GST-Karlp constructs,

GST-N-Nuflp and GST-C-Nuflp and at least one E. coli pro, tein were labeled by [3~S]Cdc31p when Ca2÷ was removed by the chelator EGTA (Fig. 6 C, +EGTA). The Ca2+-free [35S]Cdc31p did not bind to GST (data not shown), suggesting that Cdc31p interacted with the Karlp and Nuflp portions of the GST-Karlp and GST-Nuflp fusion proteins in the absence of Ca2+. Since Cdc31p interacts with GST-AKarlp but not GSTAAKarlp (Fig. 6 C), Cdc31p must bind to the COOHterminal half of Karlp. Further deletions in this region of Karlp were constructed to determine the binding site of Cdc3lp (Fig. 7 A). GST-AKarlp, GST-AKarlp-A, GST-AKarlp2A, GST-AKarlp-3A, GST-AKarlp-4A and GST were purified as described in Materials and Methods.

blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane and then incubated with [3sZ]Cdc31p. Pieces of nitrocellulose membrane containing the fusion proteins with the bound Cdc31p were excised and assayed for [35S]Cdc31p. Two times the Cdc31p was bound to GST-AKarlp than to GST-AKarlp-A, GSTAKarlp-2A and GST- AKarlp-3A (Fig. 7 B). The binding efficiency decreased further when an additional 17 amino acids of GST-AKarlp-3A were deleted (GST-AKarlp-4A), suggesting that the Cdc3 lp-binding domain of Karlp was in part removed in GST-AKarlp-4A. Since no binding of [35S]Cdc31p to GST was observed, the interaction with GSTKarlp-4A must depend on the Karlp portion of the fusion protein. The folding of GST could be responsible for the lower binding efficiencyof GST-AKarlp-A, GST-AKarlp-2A and GST-AKarlp-3A compared to GST-AKarlp. Therefore, we heat-denatured the various GST-Karlp proteins with 0.2% SDS and bound the GST-Karlp proteins under denaturing conditions to the nitrocellulose membrane. The Cdc3 lpbinding assay was then repeated. A very similar result was obtained (data not shown), indicating that the folding of GST-Karlp proteins did not influence the binding of Cdc3 lp. The comparison of the extended Cdc3 lp-binding region of Karlp-4A with CaM-binding peptides reveals a sequence with conserved features (Fig. 7 C) which, however, differs in several positions from the CaM binding sequences. Karlp is Associated with the SPB in the Absence of Cdc31p, though the Localization of Cdc31p with the SPB Is Dependent on Karlp We tested whether the interaction of Karlp with the SPB is dependent on Cdc3 lp. CDC31 of strain ESM56 is under control of the methionine-repressible MET3 promoter (Albermann, K., U. Faclder, A. Spang, K. Grein, and E. Schiebel, manuscript in preparation). The wild-type CDC31 of ESM56 is disrupted by the HIS3 gene while MET3-CDC31 is integrated into the LEU2 locus (Table I). The addition of methionine to a culture of ESM56 causes the total depletion of Cdc31p followed by a cell cycle arrest. Eight hours after the addition of methionine to a culture of ESM56, Cdc3 lp was not detectable by immunoblotting with anti-Cdc3 lp antibodies in a cell lysate (data not shown). The localization of Karlp in cells of ESM56 was investigated after depletion of Cdc3 lp by indirect immunofluorescence with anti-Karlp antibodies. Karlp was associated with the SPB of cell cycle ar-

rested ESM56 cells (Fig. 8). An identical result was obtained with cdc31-1 cells (Byers, 1981b) shifted to the non-permissive temperature (data not shown). Therefore, we concluded that Cdc3 lp is not required for the localization of Karlp with the SPB. Alternatively, Cdc31p may play a direct role in localizing Karlp to the SPB but then was lost due to turnover. We also determined whether Cdc3 lp is associated with the SPB of karl cells. A strain, ESMll5, was constructed in which KAR/is under control of the MET3 promoter. Eight hours after the addition of methionine to a culture of ESM115, cells arrested with a uniformly large bud and a single SPB. No Karlp was detectable by immunoblotting in a cell extract of ESMll5 after growth in methionine-containing medium (data not shown). Cells of ESM115 were incubated in methionine-containing medium and then prepared for immunoelectron microscopy with anti-Cdc31p antibodies as described by Spang et al. (1993). As a control, the parent strain YPH499 grown under the same conditions was labeled in parallel. The SPB of cells of YPH499 were stained at the half bridge (Spang et al., 1993; Table III). In contrast to YPH499, no SPB staining was detected in cells of ESMll5 (Table III). The levels of Cdc31p in lysates of ESMll5 and YPH499 were approximately the same (as tested by immunoblotting), indicating that Cdc31p was not degraded in the absence of Karlp (data not shown). This result suggests that binding of Cdc3 lp to the SPB requires either Karlp or that the structure of the SPB of the KAR/mutant is changed in such a way that Cdc3 lp binding is eliminated. A similar result was reported by Biggins and Rose (1994), using the temperature sensitive strain MS2083 (karl-Al7).

Discussion Localization of the Karlp Protein Despite the important role of the centrosome in each phase of the life cycle of eukaryotic cells, relatively little is known about its molecular structure and cell cycle regulation. This is also valid for yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where centrosomal functions are provided by the SPB (Byers, 1981a, b). For example, the sublocalization of only three SPB proteins have been reported to date; Nuflp/Spcll0p, 90-kD protein and Cdc31p (Kilmartin et al., 1993; Rout and Kilmartin, 1990; Spang et al., 1993). The location of these proteins within the SPB is outlined in Fig. 9 A. Karlp is also a potential SPB component. Karlp functions in karyogamy of mating yeast cells as well as in SPB duplication during mitosis (Conde and Fink, 1976; Rose and Fink, 1987). Since Karlp is essential, it is important to establish its subcellular localization. Karlp-/~-galactosidase fusion proteins were associated with the SPB in a cell cycledependent manner. Furthermore, one of these hybrid proteins localized to the outer plaque of the SPB (Vallen et al.,

1992b). Lately, the question has been raised whether the behavior of the Karlp-fl-galactosidase fusion proteins reflects that of wild-type Karlp (Biggins and Rose, 1994). In this paper, we now show that Karlp behaves quite differently from the Karlp-fl-galactosidase fusion proteins. We demonstrate for the first time that Karlp is a permanent component of the halfbridge ofthe SPB. Taken together, four lines of evidence support our conclusion: (a) Karlp cofractionated with a highly enriched preparation of SPBs (Fig. 4). (b) Karlp was associated with the SPB during the entire cell cycle, as revealed by indirect immunofluorescence (Figs. 2 and 3). (c) The half bridge or bridge of isolated SPBs was seen by immunoelectron microscopy to be labeled by affinity purified antibodies (Fig. 5, A-E). (d) Epitope tagged, functional Karlp was also associated with the half bridge as shown by immunoelectron microscopy with 12CA5 monoclonal antibodies using whole yeast cells (Fig. 5, J-L) and isolated SPBs (Fig. 5, F-l). Because the gold particles of the immunoelectron microscopy were directed toward the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope (Fig. 5, D and J-L), Karlp may be associated with the cytoplasmic side of the halfbridge or the bridge substructure of the SPB (Fig. 9 A). This suggests that the half bridge is comprised of two subcompartments, one nuclear and the other cytoplasmic, which differ in composition. At least two domains of Karlp are necessary for its localization with the halfbridge. The COOH-terminal membrane anchor targets Karlp-fl-galactosidase fusion proteins to the nuclear envelope (Fig. 9 B [/]; Vallen et al., 1992b). The center of Karlp (amino acids 190-259) can direct Karlp-fl-galactosidase fusion proteins to the SPB (Fig. 9 B [I/]). Karlp fusion proteins containing only the central domain are mistargeted to the outer plaque of the SPB (Vallen et al., 1992b). The NH2-terminus of Karlp (Fig. 9 B [lift) has functions in karyogamy (VaUenet al., 1992a) and is most likely exposed to the cytoplasm. Our working model is that Karlp is at first directed to the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope through its hydrophobic membrane anchor. In a second step, Karlp might then be targeted to the half bridge of the SPB by its interaction with at least one SPB component (Fig. 9 B; Xp). Whether this component is Cdc31p is not clear. The observation that Karlp is associated with the SPB in the absence of Cdc3 lp (Fig. 8) argues against a role of Cdc3lp in directing Karlp to the SPB. However, Cdc3lp may play a direct role in localizing Karlp to the SPB but then was lost after shifting the cdc31 cells to non-permissive conditions.

Wild-type Karlp is associated with the SPB during the entire yeast cell cycle (Fig. 3), though the Karlp-/~-gaiactosidase fusion proteins are not. We suggest that Karlp is a permanent component of the half bridge or bridge of the SPB. The Karlp wasalwaysseen by immunoelectron microscopy to be with the halfbridge or bridge ofthe SPBs isolated from an unsynchronized, logarithmic growing yeast. Since the Karlp-/~-galaetosidasefusionproteins are mistargeted to the outer plaque of the SPB, it is not surprising that they differ from wild-type Karlp in their cell cycle behavior. Interaction of Cdc31p with Karlp Mutants of both KAR/ (Rose and Fink, 1987) and CDC31 (Byers, 1981a,b) exhibit a similar phenotype; they arrest as budded cells with a single, enlarged SPB lacking a satellite. This finding suggests that the two proteins act in the same pathway in SPB duplication. A direct interaction of Karlp and Cdc31p seemed unlikely, since Karlp-fl-galactosidase and Cdc31p were localized to different substructures of the SPB complex. From our studies, it is now clear that both Karlp and Cdc31p are components of the cytoplasmic side of the half bridge (Spang et al., 1993, Fig. 5). We therefore used an in vitro assay which has been successfully used to study the interaction of CaM with target proteins (Glenney and Weber, 1980) to investigate whether Cdc31p and Karlp directly interact. Our findings clearly indicate that Cdc31p interacts in vitro with the COOH-terminal half of Karlp (Figs. 6 and 7). In addition, Cdc31pbinds to the COOH terminus of Nuflp/Spell0p, which contains a binding site for CaM (Geiser et al., 1993). Whether Cdc31p binds to the CaM-binding site of Nuflp/Spcll0p or whether the latter protein contains an additional Cdc31p-binding motif remains to be determined. The significance of this interaction is not clear, especially because Cdc31p and Nuflp/Spc110p are associated with different substructures of the SPB (Fig. 9 A). However, CaM did not bind to Karlp, indicating a different substrate specificity of the two Ca2+-bindingproteins. The Ca2+dependence of the interaction of CaM and Cdc31p with substrates was also different. While CaM did not bind to any protein in the absence of Ca2+(Fig. 6 D, Geiser et al., 1993), Cdc31p interacted with additional proteins (one E. coli protein, NH2 terminus of Nuflp/Spc110p and Karlp, Abb. 6C) when Ca2+was removed by EGTA. Although we have not studied the Ca2+-independentinteractions of Cdc31p further, our observations suggest that the binding specificity of Cdc3lp is regulated by Ca2+.The proteins that interacted with Cdc31p in the absence of Ca2÷ may have binding sites which are only recognized by Ca2+free Cdc3lp. We have localized the core of one Cdc3lp-binding site of Karlp to amino acids 237 to 255 (Fig. 7, A and B) which is indicated by the binding of Cdc3lp to GST-ZkKarl-4A.The total Cdc3lp-binding region of Karlp is probably larger than the 18 amino acids of AKarlp-4A. This is suggested by the observation that NH2-terminal (AKarlp) and COOH-terminal extensions (AKarlp-A,AKarlp-2Aand zkKarlp-3A)ofthe zkKarlp-4Apeptide increase the efficiencyof Cdc3lp-binding (Fig. 7 B). We do not think that the folding of GST inhibits the interaction ofCdc31pwith Karlp, since unfolding ofGST by SDS did not influence the binding of Cdc31p to the GSTKarlp constructs. We compared amino acids 230-260 of Karlp with published CaM-binding peptides. Amino acids 239-257 of Karlphad several features in commonwith the CaM-binding peptides (Fig. 7 C). The positively charged amino acids at positions I, 2, 3, 12, 16, and the hydrophobic amino acids at positions 13 and 14 were also present in 2 of the 3 CaMbinding peptides (Fig. 7 C). The acidic amino acid in position 7 and the basic amino acids in positions 9, 18, and 19 coincided with one of the three CaM-binding peptides. In contrast to the CaM-binding peptides, the potential Cdc31pbinding site contained three acidic amino acids which are not found in CaM-binding motifs and might determine the specificity of the interaction with Cdc31p. Furthermore, computer analysis of this potential Cdc31p-binding peptide bythe method ofRostet al. (1993)predicted a highprobabilityofalpha-helical conformation. This is also the conformation of CaM-binding peptides (O'Neil et al., 1987). While this manuscript was in preparation, Biggins and Rose (1994) reported the interaction of Cdc31p with Karlp using a very similar approach. The Cdc31p-binding domain was localized to amino acids 187-299 of Karlp including the portion of Karlp which we mapped as Cdc31p-binding region (amino acids 237-255). It remains unclear why Karlp-/~-galactosidase fusion proteins encoded by plasmids pMR404 (amino acids 1-259 ofKarlp) and pMR1850(amino acids 187-259) did not interact with Cdc31p (Biggins and Rose, 1994). These fusion proteins were expressed in yeast and enriched by immunoprecipitation. Possibly, the fusion site with /~-galactosidase at the COOH terminus of the Cdc31p-binding motifinterferes with Cdc3Ip-binding. Further, Bigginsand Rose (1994) did not observe a Ca2+-dependence ofCdc3lp-binding, although they reported an increase in background binding when EGTA was present. This discrepancy might be explained by different methods used for the labeling of Cdc3lp in the two studies. We specifically labeled Cdc31p in vivo using the T7 system, and then purified the 35S-labeled protein. Biggins and Rose (1994) labeled purified Cdc31p with a sulphur labeling kit that adds 35Sto free amino groups and therefore modifies Cdc31p. The question remains, whether Cdc3lp and Karlp interact in vivo. Wehavenotbeen able to demonstrate the interaction of Karlp and Cdc31p by immunoprecipitation with antiCdc31por anti-Karlp antibodies (A. Spang, unpublished observations). The reasons for this might be twofold. The complex containing Karlp and Cdc3lp may be disrupted during the extraction of SPBs. Alternatively Karlp and Cdc3lp may interact only transiently during a short period of the cell cycle. Karlp has a potential p34c°c2~ phosphorylation site (TPTK; Moreno and Nurse, 1990) at amino acids 294-297 which couldbe involvedin such a regulation. Genetic studies by Vallenet al. (1994)identified CDC31as a high copy number and ectrogenic suppressor ofa temperature sensitive mutation of KARLWhile this suggests an interaction ofCdc31p and Karlp, some cdc31 alleles suppressed a complete deletion ofKAR/(VaUenet al., 1994), favoringa bypass mechanism. In summary, considering the colocalization of Karlp and Cdc3lp within the same substructure of the SPB (Fig. 5; Spang et al., 1993), the in vitro interaction of Cdc31p and Karlp (Figs. 7 and 8; Bigginsand Rose, 1994)and the genetic interaction between CDC31 and KAR/(Vallen et al., 1994) it is most likely that Cdc31p and Karlp interact at least transiently in vivo.

Spang et al. Karlp, a Cdc31p-binding Protein of the SPB Half Bridge 875


Interestingly, amino acids 235 to 294 of Karlp can be deleted without affecting the viability of yeast cells, while a deletion of amino acids 191-246 caused a temperature sensitive phenotype (Vallen et al., 1992a). These deletions interfere with the minimal Cdc3 lp-binding site which we have identified (amino acids 237-255; Fig. 7 A) and with the more extended region of Biggins and Rose (1994; amino acids 190-299 of Karlp). This finding raises the question, such as whether the Cdc3 lp-binding site(s) of Karlp fulfill an essential function? Vallen et al. (1994) proposed a model in which Karlp helps to localize Cdc31p to the SPB and the Cdc31p then initiates SPB duplication via interaction with a downstream effector. We favor a modified version of this model in which Cdc31p and Karlp are permanent components of the cytoplasmic side of the half bridge of the SPB (Spang et al., 1993; Figs. 2 and 3). Cdc31p and Karlp may form a complex with at least one additional protein Xp (Fig. 9 B). Xp has binding sites for both Karlp and Cdc3 lp. A potential candidate for Xp is a 30kD protein which has been demonstrated by cross-linking studies to be next to Cdc31p (A. Spang, unpublished observations). Signals from Cdc31p and Karlp would be transmitted to Xp, which then initiates formation of the satellite in early Gz phase of the cell cycle. The Karlp signal could be the dephosphorylation of Karlp at the end of mitosis. Cdc31p, on the other hand, could sense local changes in Ca2÷concentration. We assume that the signals transmitted to Xp by Karlp and Cdc31p are in some way redundant. However, it is possible that Karlp and Cdc3 lp may be active during different phases of the cell cycle. Mutations in CDC31 could result in a Cdc3 lp* which is activated earlier in the cell cycle, perhaps by an altered binding constant for Ca2÷, and therefore fully overlaps with the Karlp signal. This would explain why certain mutations in CDC31 can substitute for deletions in KARL In summary, we consider the Cdc31p/Karlp/Xp complex to be a key regulator in SPB duplication which may transmit cell cycle-specific signals to yet unknown components of the SPB.
