let sensitivity caused by deletion of the UbLR23 domain may therefore arise from its inability to interact with the proteasome. The fusion proteins glutathione S-transferase (GST)­Rad23 and Rad4­haemagglutinin (HA), and the proteasome subunits Cim3 and Cim5, cofractionate through consecutive chromatography steps. The ubiquitin-like domain of human Rad23 (UbLHRB) also interacts with the human proteasome. These results demonstrate that ubiquitin-like domains (UbLs) represent a new class of Rad23 has an unusual N-terminal domain that bears a striking resemblance to ubiquitin1. This domain, which we call UbLR23, is important for DNA repair because its elimination causes sensitivity to ultraviolet irradiation1. Rad23 was isolated in a search for suppressors of the toxicity caused by overexpressing the ubiquitin-dependent N-end rule pathway6, suggesting that Rad23 might have a proteolytic function in DNA repair. To explore this idea we linked Rad23 and two truncated mutants to glutathione

Rad23 is an evolutionarily conserved protein that is important for nucleotide excision repair1­3. A regulatory role has been proposed for Rad23 because rad23 mutants are sensitive to ultraviolet light but are still capable of incising damaged DNA4,5. Here we show that Rad23 interacts with the 26S proteasome through an aminoterminal ubiquitin-like domain (UbLR23). The carboxy terminus of Rad23 binds to the Rad4 DNA repair protein and creates a link between the DNA repair and proteasome pathways. The ultravio-

epitopes on either the N terminus (Flag­Rad23; Fig. 1d) or the C terminus (Rad23­HA; data not shown), also interacted with the proteasome. Both Cim3 and Cim5 were detected in anti-Flag immunoprecipitates prepared from yeast cells expressing Flag­ complement rad23D (ref. 1), these findings suggest that the Rad23­ proteasome interaction is important for DNA repair. These data also show that UbLR23 represents a new proteasome interaction signal. A large family of proteins bearing ubiquitin-like extensions has been identified, and our results suggest that they too have proteolytic functions9. To determine whether the GST­Rad23 interacting complex included 20S catalytic subunits we analysed extracts from cells expressing Pre1-Flag (28K) or Pup1­HA (33K), both of which are epitope-tagged derivatives of 20S -subunits8. Both Pup1­HA (Fig. 1b, lane 2) and Pre1-Flag (data not shown) were detected in GST­ Rad23 beads after incubation with HA or Flag antibodies, confirming the presence of 20S catalytic subunits. GST­UbLR23 accumulated to higher levels than GST­Rad23, and the recovery of Pup1­ HA was proportionately higher (Fig. 1b, compare lanes 2 and 4). To confirm that our findings applied to native Rad23, we immunoprecipitated Pre1­Flag on Flag­agarose beads, resolved interacting proteins on an SDS­polyacrylamide gel, and incubated a western blot with Rad23-specific antibodies. Native Rad23 was readily detectable in immunoprecipitates containing Pre1­Flag but not from a control extract lacking this epitope-tagged proteasome subunit (Fig. 1c). Approximately 5% of cellular Rad23 precipitated with Pre1­Flag (an estimate that is based on the amount of Rad23 that remained on the Flag­agarose beads after 18 h at 4 C). The in vivo interaction could be higher if the interaction with the proteasome is transient or regulated. The interaction of Rad23 with apparently intact 26S proteasome led us to test whether the complex had ATPase and proteolytic activities. We purified GST­Rad23 interacting proteins on glutathione­Sepharose beads and found significant chymotrypsin activity, consistent with that found in the 20S proteasome (Fig. 2a). We also detected high levels of trypsin and peptidylglutamylhydrolytic activities in the GST­Rad23 beads (data not shown), and ATPase activity was detected in the beads containing GST­Rad23 (Fig. 2b). The presence of Cim3 and Cim5 in Rad23 immunoprecipitates strongly suggests that they contribute to this ATPase activity. In agreement with these findings, Flag­Rad23 precipitates also had ATPase and protease activities (data not shown). Rad23 and Rad4, as well as the human counterparts HHR23-B and XPC, form stable interactions2,10. We therefore tested whether GST­Rad23 interacts with components of the DNA repair and proteolytic pathways. We linked Rad4 to the HA epitope (Rad4­ HA) and found that it complemented rad4D (data not shown). GST­Rad23 and Rad4­HA were expressed simultaneously in yeast cells and were metabolically labelled with [35S]methionine. Radiolabelled extracts were applied to glutathione­Sepharose and bound proteins analysed by SDS­PAGE and fluorography; Rad4­ HA was found to interact with GST­Rad23 (Fig. 3, lane 2). The interaction of Rad4­HA with GST­Rad23 did not require UbLR23 (lane 3), demonstrating that distinct regions of Rad23 interact with the proteolytic and DNA repair pathways (compare Figs 1a and 3). Identical samples were transferred to nitrocellulose and analysed by incubation with anti-HA antibodies and, consistent with these findings, Rad4­HA was detected only in lanes 2 and 3 (data not shown). These findings are in agreement with a recent report showing that 21 C-terminal residues in Rad23 are important for interaction with Rad4 (ref. 11). To characterize the interaction of Rad4 with Rad23 we prepared extracts from cells expressing both GST­Rad23 and Rad4­HA and separated proteins on Sephacryl S200. GST­Rad23 was detected in the void volume coincident with dextran blue, and also in fractions corresponding to its predicted

monomeric size ( 716

80K). Rad4­HA, Cim5 and GST­Rad23 could

each be detected in the high-molecular-weight fraction, suggesting that they are components of a single complex (Fig. 4a­c, lane 2). To investigate this further, proteins in the Sephacryl S-200 void volume were chromatographed on Mono-Q. Rad4­HA, Cim5 and GST­ Rad23 were detected in fractions eluting at 0.35 M KCl. These fractions were previously shown to contain catalytically active 26S proteasome12. Fractions that eluted between 325 and 375 mM KCl from the Mono-Q column were pooled (Fig. 4a­c, lane 3) and chromatographed on Mono-S. Rad4­HA and Cim5 again cofractionated with GST­Rad23 (Fig. 4a­c, lanes 15­18), and a peak of ATPase activity copurified with the GST­Rad23 interacting complex (Fig. 4d).

pep4 prb1, which is defective in vacuolar proteolysis13 (Fig. 5d). Thus Rad23­HA degradation requires the 26S proteasome. This result raises the possibility that proteasome mutants might be defective in DNA repair. We measured the ultraviolet sensitivity of cim3-1 and cim5-1 cells at the permissive temperature and observed a five- to tenfold decrease in survival (data not shown). tribute to ultraviolet sensitivity strengthens the connection between DNA repair and the ubiquitin­proteasome pathway. A role for protein degradation is also suggested by the rapid degradation of Rad23 variants. Two human homologues of Rad23, HHR23-A and HHR23-B (ref. 2), contain N-terminal ubiquitin-like domains, suggesting that they act in a similar way to the yeast protein. HHR23-B forms a stable interaction with XPC, the human counterpart of Rad4. We linked the ubiquitin-like domain of HHR23-B (UbLHRB) to GST to explore the functional relatedness among this class of proteins. GST­UbLHRB was purified from yeast and incubated with HeLa cell nuclear (Fig. 6) and S100 cytoplasmic extracts (data not shown).

GST­Rad23 and Cim5 (lane 5) was used as a control for the antibody reaction. The biochemical function of Rad23 is poorly understood. Studies using reconstituted protein complexes have shown that Rad23 promotes the assembly of various repair factors10,14,15. Rad23 interacts with TFIIH and Rad14 (ref. 5), and can stabilize the preincision complex16. Furthermore, Rad23 from both yeast and humans (HHR23-B) forms a stable complex with Rad4 (XPC in humans)2,5. It has been shown that purified Rad4 (XPC) is always isolated as a heterodimer containing Rad23 (HHR23-B). These results are consistent with the report that HHR23 regulates the activity of XPC15. Unfortunately, the use of different experimental protocols to measure DNA repair in rad23 has yielded highly discordant results. Although the intermediate survival rate of rad23 is well accepted, some reports have suggested that rad23 removes dimers very inefficiently17, whereas others showed a substantial level of repair15. Use of a reconstituted system showed that a specific DNA adduct was excised in the complete absence of XPC/ HHR23-B14. The primary DNA lesions induced by ultraviolet irradiation are 6-4 photoproducts and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers17,18. The removal of these lesions, and repair synthesis in minichromosomes19, have been reported to be inhibited in rad23. A regulatory role for Rad23 is suggested by its known functions, including modulation of Rad4 activity, intermediate ultraviolet sensitivity, its requirement for repair-complex assembly, and our finding that it interacts with the proteasome. Various studies of the role of Rad23 suggest that its activities might be influenced by the type of lesion, and by subtle effects of growth and strain background. In addition to its role in the assembly of repair proteins, Rad23 may also regulate disassembly of the complex. Specifically, the UbLR23-mediated interaction of Rad23 with the proteasome might promote its degradation, causing dissociation of the repair complex. This feature alone might account for several discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo results. We also propose that the degradation of Rad23 could regulate the recycling of the repair complex, which could, at least in part, explain the repair deficiency in rad23. In support of this idea we found that native Rad23 is ubiquitinated and degraded during the transition between the G1 and S phases of the cell cycle (data not shown).

Methods Recombinant methods. The genes RAD23, RAD4 and PUP1 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from yeast strain YPH500 (ref. 6) and cloned into EcoR1- and KpnI-digested pKM1362-2 (ref. 6) to generate Rad23­ HA, Rad4­HA and Pup1­HA. Pre1-Flag was provided by J. Dohmen. Appropriate oligonucleotides were used to generate UbLR23 (codons 1­77 and DUbL Rad23 (codons 78­398). UbLHRB was generated by PCR from a cDNA template. RAD23 fragments were linked to GST in pCBGST1 (ref. 20) and expressed by adding 0.1 mM CuSO4 to the growth medium. Preparation of protein extracts and immunological methods. To demonstrate co-purification of DNA repair and proteasome subunits, yeast strain LCY156 (MHY501 (ref. 21) expressing GST­Rad23 and Rad4­HA) was grown to late-logarithmic stage in synthetic medium, pelleted and frozen at -70 C. Yeast cells were suspended in lysis buffer (25mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM potassium acetate, 1 mM EDTA and 20% glycerol) containing 10 mM -mercaptoethanol. A mixture of protease inhibitors (including PMSF, leupeptin, aprotinin, antipain and chymostatin) was added immediately before lysis by glass-bead disruption. Protein extracts were precipitated with 80% ammonium sulphate, dissolved in 1 ml gel-filtration buffer (1 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl and 10% glycerol), and separated through Sephacryl S-200. The void volume was collected and chromatographed on FPLC Mono-Q. Fractions corresponding to 325­375 mM in a linear KCl gradient were pooled, diluted and chromatographed on Mono-S. A linear gradient of KCl was applied to Mono-S and fractions collected and applied to glutathione­ Sepharose to allow binding of GST­Rad23 and associated proteins. The samples were boiled for 3 min in sample buffer containing SDS and

resolved on SDS­polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked in 5% milk and incubated with antisera at 1:1,000 (antiRad23, anti-HA and anti-Flag) or 1:5,000 dilution (anti-Cim3 and antiCim5), and proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham). To test for interactions between GST and Flag-linked Rad23 derivatives and proteasome subunits, yeast cells were lysed as described above and extracts applied directly to glutathione­Sepharose (or Flag­agarose). Proteins bound to these beads were separated on two SDS­polyacrylamide gels, one of which was transferred to nitrocellulose, and the other was stained with Coomassie blue to estimate the expression levels of the GST fusion proteins. ATPase and protease assays. The GST fusion proteins were adsorbed to glutathione­Sepharose beads, washed and assayed for protease and ATPase activities22,23. Protease substrates included N-CBZ-Leu-Leu-Glu- -naphthylamide (PGP-like activity), N-CBZ-Ala-Arg-Arg-4-methoxy- -naphthylamide (trypsin-like activity) and N-CBZ-Gly-Gly-Leu-p-nitroanilide (chymotrypsinlike activity). Protein stability. Pulse-chase measurements were as described6. Briefly, yeast cells expressing Rad23­HA were labelled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 5 min. The cells were washed in chase medium containing excess cold methionine and cysteine and 0.5 mg ml-1 cycloheximide, and samples were withdrawn at intervals and analysed by immunoprecipitation.
