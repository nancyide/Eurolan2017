In the present study, we have used the two-hybrid system (Fields and Song, 1989) to investigate protein-protein contacts between RNA polymerase I11specific subunits. In this system, one protein is fused to the DNA-binding domain of the transcriptionactivator GAL4, GAL4(1-1471, while the otheris fusedto the transcriptionactivationdomain of this factor, GAL4(768-881). If the two proteins interact, an artificial heterodimeric activator is produced, the activity of which can be monitored bythe expression of a GAL.1-1acZ reporter gene. We have foundthat subunits C82, C34,and C31each interact with the other two subunits, thus supporting the view that they form a subcomplex. We then went on to showthat C34 contactsthe 70-kDa subunitof transcription factorIIIB (TFIIIB),l suggesting that this interaction is a determinant that directsRNA polymerase I11 to its cognate genes.

Itstwo largest subunitsare homologous tothe largest subunits of yeast RNApolymerase I and 11, common to RNA polymerasesI and 111,and five small polypeptides are shared by all three RNA polymerases. Finally, subunits C82, C53, C34,and C31 are specific to RNA polymerase I11and have no counterpart in RNA polymerasesI and 11.All these polypeptides have been shown to be essential for tRNA transcription in uivo and for cell viability (Chiannilkulchai et al.,1992b;Mann et al., 1992; Stettler et al., 1992; Mosrin et al., 1990). In previous studies, we have found that a mutant enzyme affected in the N-terminal zinc-binding region of C160, the largest subunit of yeast RNA polymerase 111, lost three subunits, (C82, C34, and C31) upon inactivation, raising the possibility that these subunitsinteractwitheachother (Werner et al., 1992). The existence of subunits specific to one enzyme also suggests that they could be targets for contacts between that particular RNA polymerase and its cognate initiation factors or activators. * This work was supported by Grant SCI-CT91-0702 fromthe European Economic Community.The costsof publication ofthis article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges.

P-galactosidaseactivity measurements, individualtransformants were grown in 50-mlcultures of SC mediumwheredextrosewas replacedby 2% ethanol, 2%glycerol, and 2% galactose as describedpreviously (Fields and Song, 1989). GALA Fusion Constructions-TheGAL4-RNA polymerase subunit fusionswere constructedby engineeringa BamHI site at -8 relative to the initiator codonof each RNA polymerase 111subunit gene and a BamHI site downstream and close to the stop codon. The downstream sites were placedat position 1981of the RPC82 geneencodingsubunit C82 (Chiannilkulchai et al., 1992b1,position 1277 of the RPC53 gene encoding subunit C53 (Mann et al., 1992),position 964 of the RPC34 geneencodingsubunit C34(Stettleret al., 1992),and position 767 ofthe RPC31 gene encoding subunit C31 (Mosrin et al., 1990).The BamHI siteswere introducedby oligonucleotide-directedmutagenesis for genes RPC82,RPC34, and RPC31 and by PCR for RPC53.BamHI sites present in RPC31 and RPC82 were removed by mutating T732 to Cc in RPC31 and T1338to Cc in RPC82. These changes affected wobble positions of codonsand thus didnot change the protein sequencesof the C31 and C82 subunits. The GALI-TBP(TATAbox-bindingprotein) fusions wereconstructed by PCR amplificationof nucleotides -2 to +740 of SPT15 (Cavalliniet al., 1989; Eisenmann et al., 1989;Hahn et aZ., 1989; Horikoshiet al.,1989; Schmidtet al., 1989).The oligonucleotide primers had a BamHI sitepositioned in order to create sites at -8 and +741in the amplified fragment.BamHI fragments were then cloned in pMA424 forthe fusionswith GAL4(1-147) and pGAD2F forthe fusions The abbreviationsused are: TFIIIB,transcription factorIIIB;PCR, P.

TABLEI RNA polymeraseIII subunit interactions visualized by the two-hybrid system RNA polymerase 111subunit interactions were tested in GGY1::171 transformants having one subunit fused to the DNA-binding domainof GAL4(1-147) and the other to the GALA(768-881) activation domain.

GAL.1-lac2ActivationAssay-Cells from fourindependent transformants for each combination of plasmids tested were grown as patches for 2 days at 30"ConSC solidmedium containing 2% dextrose as carbon source for GGY1::171 transformants or 2% raffinoseforY526 transformants. Fusionplasmidswere selectedasdescribed above. p-Galactosidase activity was revealed by overlaying the cells with 10ml of X-galagar (0.5%agar, 500mM potassiumphosphatebuffer, pH7.0,0.1% SDS, 7%Nfl-dimethyl formamide,0.4 mg/ml5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-P-D-galactopyranoside) and incubating the plates for 24 h at 30 "C. P-Galactosidase activity was measured in transformants showing GALJ-lac2activationin the Petri dish assay.This was done bygrowing a 50-mlculture of the transformant to 1ODs0 unit inSC mediumwith 2% ethanol, 2%glycerol, and 2% galactose. Cellswere washed in 2 buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mM KC], 1mM MgSO,, 10%glycerol, 40 mM p-mercaptoethanol),resuspended in 500 111 of 2 buffer, and disrupted by vortexing with glass beads in an Eppendorf tube. The extract was clarified by centrifugation for 15min at 15,000 rpm and 4 "C. P-Galactosidasewas assayed in the extract as described previously (Miller,1972). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The two-hybrid system (Fields and Song, 1989) has been used to study interactions amongfour RNA polymerase IIIspecific subunits andbetween these subunits andtwo recently identified componentsof the initiation factorTFIIIB.The complete C82 (Chiannilkulchai et al., 1992b),C53 (Mann et al., 1992),C34 (Stettler et al., 1992),and C31(Mosrinet al., 1990) subunits were fused to the C terminus of the transcription activation domain or the DNA-bindingdomain ofGAL4. In both cases the fusion protein was expressed from an ADHl promoter on a multicopyplasmid. The expressionof the fusion proteins was monitored by Western blotting using antibodies directed against the corresponding RNA polymerase I11 subunit(Huet et al., 1985). Proteins of the expectedsizewere detected inall cases exceptforGAL4(768-881)-C31fusion (data not shown). Yeast cells containing all possible single or pairwise combinations of the four subunits fused to the GAL4 activation or DNA-binding domains were tested. The results presented in TableI showthat theGAL1-lac2indicator gene was expressed in all the transformants having a combination of C82, C34,or C31subunits, with the exceptionof transformants having both GAL(l-l47)-C82 and GAL4(768-881)-C31.This latter observation was readily explainedby the factthat GAL4(76&881)-C31 was not detected on Westernblots.

147)-C34 fusionstrongly activated transcription by itself, suggesting that C34 bears an activation domain (seebelow). Activation of the GALl-lac2gene,as measured by cell colorationon 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-~-~-galactopyoside plates,has been confirmedby P-galactosidaseassays of selectedtransformants (Table11).The level of p-galactosidaseactivation found forthe interacting RNApolymerase subunit pairswas foundto be in samerange asthat observedby Fieldsand Song(1989)for their model interaction between SNFl and SNFI proteins (Table11). The specificityof the interaction between C82, C34,and C31 was suggested by the fact that none of these subunits selfassociated and that the C53 subunit was unable to interact with any of the other subunitseventhough C53fusionproteins were detected by Westernblotting. Moreover, noneof the RNA polymerase 111-specificsubunit fusions could activate GALllac2 transcription when cotransformedwith fusions of any of the seven other subunits (out of the nine subunits remaining) tested inthe two-hybrid system3 (Lalo et al., 1993).

strongly argues against thepossibility that theobserved interactions are indirect and due to the presence of a free endogenous RNA polymerase I11 subunit bridging the two subunits tested. The existence of protein-protein contacts between C82, C34, and C31 is supported by our previous observation (Werner et al., 1992) that these three subunits were simultaneously lost during inactivation of a RNApolymerase 111mutant affected in the zinc-binding domain of the C160 subunit.Furthermore, overexpression of the C160 subunit is known tosuppress a mutation in the C31 ~ u b u n i tand overexpression of C31 in , ~ turnsuppresses a mutationin C82 (Chiannilkulchai et al., 1992b). Taken together, these data strongly suggest thatC31, C34, and C82 form a complex that interacts with the largest subunit ofRNA polymerase 111.These subunit-subunit interactions are schematically summarized in Fig. 1. C34 alone, when fused to GAL4(1-147) activated transcription of the GAL1-lac2reporter gene (Tables I and 11).The level of activation by this fusion protein was 4-15 times stronger than that observed for the interacting hybrids, including the control SNF1-SNF4 hybrid (Table 11).Thus, C34 bears a domain able to activate transcriptionby RNApolymerase 11.This property was unique toC34 as the other three subunits(C82, C53, and C31)that were fusedto GAL4(1-147) did not activate transcription from the reporter gene (Tables I and 11).Similarly, fusionsof ABClOP, AC19,or AC40 to GAL4(1-147) could not activate transcriptionby themselves (Laloet al., 1993).The activation property of C34 was dependenton the presence of a DNA-binding domain since fusion of C34 with theGAL4(768881)activation domain did not activatelac2 transcription. We reasoned that activation of RNApolymerase I1transcription by GAL4(1-147)-C34could be due to the interactionof the S. Stettler and P Thuriaux, unpublished results. C34 subunit with a factor that is common to both RNApolymerase I1and I11transcription orwith an RNApolymerase I1 factor that is structurally related to an RNA polymerase I11 factor. Two such factors have been recently described. One is the TATA-binding protein, a class-lessfactorrequired by all three RNA polymerases (Cormack and Struhl,1992;Schultz et al., 1992; Sharp, 1992; White et al., 1992).The second is the TFIIIB 70-kDa subunit (TFIIIBTO),which is homologous to TFIIB (Buratowski and Zhou, 1992; Colbert and Hahn, 1992; Lbpez-De-Lebnet al., 1992). Therefore, we tested the interaction of C34 with TBPor TFIIIBTOusing thetwo-hybrid system. TheentireTBPproteinwas fused to GAL4(1-147) and to GAL4(768-881). The GAL4(1-147)-TBP fusion was able to activate GALI-lacZ transcription on its own but only 30 times less than GAL4(1-147)-C34 (Table 11).However, neither of the two TBP fusionswas able to interact with ofthe seven RNA any polymerase I11 subunits since no GAL1-lac2 activation above control levels was detected. The entire TFIIIBTo protein was also fusedto GAL4(1-147) and withGAL4(768-881). Fkmarkably,of the seven RNApolymeraseI11subunits tested,only C34 interacted with TFIIIBTO (TablesI1and 111). TFIIIBT0, togetherwith TBP anda fraction termed TFIIIB" (which contains a 90-kDa polypeptide), constitutes transcription factor TFIIIB (Kassavetiset al., 1991, 1992). It has been demonstrated biochemically that TFIIIB.DNA complexes stripped of assembly factorscan directmultiple rounds of transcription by RNA polymerase 111. This indicatesa direct interaction between RNA polymerase 111and one or more components of the initiation factor TFIIIB (Kassavetiset al., 1990). Our data strongly support view and argue infavor of arole this for the C82C344231complex in directing RNA polymerase I11 binding to the TFIIIB.DNA complex via the interaction between TFIIIBTo and C34 (Fig. l).This observation is further strengthened by the observation that antibodiesdirected

against C34 subunit strongly inhibit the specific transcription of a tRNA gene but are much less inhibitory in a nonspecific transcription assay (Huetet al., 1985).The possibility remains that TFIIIC or some other component of TFIIIB might also contact RNApolymerase I11and thereby contribute to the formation of the initiation complex.A further implication of this work is that the C82C34C31subunit complex must be located close to the initiation site as indicated in our model(Fig. 1).

ing experiments, that amongall RNApolymerase I11subunits, C34 extends the furthest upstream on the promoter (Bartholomew et al., 1993). The role of TFIIIB70 in directing RNA polymerase I11 transcription initiation also has implicationsfor the mechanism of RNA polymerase I1 initiation. TFIIB, the TFIIIBTohomolog, must be present to direct the binding ofRNA polymerase I1to the preinitiation complex(Buratowskiet al.,1989).By analogy with the C34.TFIIIB70interaction, it islikely that RNA polymerase 11is directed to its initiation site by interaction with TFIIB.It shouldbe noted, however,that no sequencesimilarity has been detected between C34 and RNA polymerase I1 subunits (Young, 1991;Sentenac et al., 1992;Thuriaux and Sentenac, 1992).
