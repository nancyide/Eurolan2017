Abstract Background: Cofilin is a low-molecular weight actinmodulating protein, and is structurally and functionally conserved among eukaryotes. Cofilin is encoded by COF1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and is essential for cell viability. Cofilin binds to and severs actin filaments in vitro, and also enhances their depolymerization. A partner protein that cooperates with cofilin in vivo has not been identified. Results: When COF1 was over-expressed in yeast cells under the GAL1 promoter in a medium containing galactose as a sole carbon source, the cells did not survive. These results indicate that cells can grow only when the expression of cofilin is appropriately regulated. Several temperature sensitive (ts-) mutants were independently created by the random mutagenesis of COF1 with hydroxylamine. Mutated amino acids in ts-mutants were mapped in

the sequences that were presumed to be involved in actin binding. A gene on a multicopy plasmid which suppresses the ts-phenotype of cof1-101, a typical tscofilin mutant, was isolated. The suppressor gene, SCF1, was found to be identical to AIP1, a gene encoding an actin-interacting protein. Although SCF1/AIP1 is not essential for cell viability, a combination of cof1-101 and Dscf1/aip1 is synthetic lethal. Immunofluorescence staining of a wild-type strain using anti-Aip1 antibodies revealed that Aip1 was distributed in cortical actin patches where cofilin was also co-localized. Thick and long fibres stained with anti-cofilin antibody were detected in Dscf1/aip1 cells, but not in SCF1/AIP1 cells. Conclusions: These results suggest the cooperative modulation of the actin cytoskeleton by cofilin and Aip1.

Introduction The actin cytoskeleton is involved in various cellular processes such as cell motility and division, and is regulated by multiple systems. Among a number of actinregulatory proteins, cofilin (Nishida et al. 1984) is unique in that it is essential for cell viability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Iida et al. 1993; Moon et al. 1993), Dictyostelium discoideum (Aizawa et al. 1995), Drosophila (Gunsalus et al. 1995) and Caenorhabditis elegans (McKim et al. 1994). The lethality of Dcof1 yeast cells was rescued by expressing mammalian cofilin in these cells (Iida et al. 1993), suggesting that the functions of cofilin have been conserved throughout evolution. Cofilin and its closely related proteins, including destrin/ADF (Bamburg et al. 1980; Nishida et al. 1985), actophorin (Cooper et al. 1986), and depactin (Mabuchi 1981) compose a protein

family, called the cofilin family, whose members are ubiquitously distributed in eukaryotes (for review see Lappalainen et al. 1998). Previous studies have demonstrated that cofilin binds in vitro to both filamentous (F-) and globular, monomeric (G-) actin (Nishida et al. 1984), and depolymerizes and severs F-actin in vitro (Nishida et al. 1985; Cooper et al. 1986; Maciver et al. 1991; Hawkins et al. 1993). The in vivo functions of cofilin on actin appear to be somewhat uncertain. Cofilin has been reported to accelerate actin filament turnover, which includes actin depolymerization, both in vitro (Carlier et al. 1997; Rosenblatt et al. 1997) and in yeast cells (Lappalainen & Drubin 1997). On the other hand, it has also been demonstrated that the over-expression of cofilin in Dictyostelium and mammalian cells induces bundles of actin filaments (Aizawa et al. 1996; Moriyama et al. 1996), and increases a proportion of filamentous actin, rather than that of monomeric actin (Aizawa et al. 1996). To reconcile these apparent inconsistencies, the

regulatory mechanisms of cofilin functions need to be elucidated. Cofilin preferentially binds to ADP-actin rather than ATP-actin (Maciver & Weeds 1994). Previous reports by ourselves and others have shown that cofilin function is regulated in at least three different ways. Actindepolymerization or destruction activity is pH-dependent (Yonezawa et al. 1985; Hawkins et al. 1993), is inhibited by phosphoinositides such as PIP2 (Yonezawa et al. 1990), and is negatively regulated by phosphorylation at the third serine residue (Agnew et al. 1995; Moriyama et al. 1996). In addition to these regulatory mechanisms, cofilin may perhaps exert its functions in concert with other proteins. This study was conducted with the aim of identifying a partner protein to cofilin using yeast genetics. Temperature-sensitive (ts-) mutants of cofilin were created and characterized, after which a multicopy suppressor of the ts-phenotype was isolated. The gene, SCF1 (a suppressor of ts-cofilin) was identical to AIP1 which had been previously reported to encode an actin-interacting protein (Amberg et al. 1995). Results Phenotypes of cofilin-depleted or cofilin-overexpressing cells LG1 is a strain which expresses cofilin under the control of the GAL1 promoter. As expected, LG1 cells did not

grow in a medium that contains glucose as the sole carbon source (Fig. 1). Unexpectedly, LG1 cells did not grow in a medium containing 2% galactose as the sole carbon source, although they grew well in a medium containing a mixture of galactose and glucose. When LG1 cells were incubated in a medium containing glucose but no galactose, the proportion of large cells with a small bud gradually increased (Fig. 2A) and two nuclei frequently remained in the mother cells (Fig. 2B,C). Thick aggregates of filamentous actin accumulated in cofilin-depleted cells (Fig. 2D,E). Yeast cells harbouring YEpYCS, a multicopy plasmid carrying COF1, expressed several-fold cofilin, and grew normally (data not shown). These cells were found to contain rod or bundle-like structures labelled with anticofilin antibody (Fig. 2F). However, these structures were not labelled with phalloidin.

Isolation of temperature-sensitive mutants of COF1 A COF1-carrying centromere plasmid pRS-YCS with HIS3 was treated with hydroxylamine and transferred into cells of a Dcof1 strain L2A harbouring another COF1-carrying centromere plasmid with URA3 (YCp-YCS). The transfected cells were grown and subjected to treatment with 5-fluoro-orotic acid. Hisþ Ura­ transformants containing only the mutagenized plasmid were examined for temperature sensitivity. Six

LG1 cells were precultured to log-phase in a minimal medium containing 0.67% glucose and 1.33% galactose and diluted to OD600 ¼ 0.02 with indicated media. Each minimal medium contained a total of 2% sugars (glucose and/or galactose at different ratios). The cultures were incubated for 23 h at 30 C, and their turbidity (OD600) was determined.

ts-clones were obtained from 1200 HisþUra­

transformants (Fig. 3). Plasmids were recovered from each clone, after which the vector backbone was replaced by the corresponding fragment of unmutagenized DNA. Mutated sequences were determined on the plasmid DNA, which revealed that all six mutants had one or a few amino acid changes (Table 1). Mutated amino acids are localized in a narrow region corresponding to the actin-binding long -helix (Hatanaka et al. 1996; Fedorov et al. 1997; Leonard et al. 1997). Of the six independently isolated mutants, D1 and B3, and D3 and C1 had the same mutations. All the mutants were

recessive. Since the growth of E1 (cof1-101) was most strictly inhibited at 37 C, we mainly used E1 for further study. The chromosomal COF1 was replaced by the mutant allele cof1-101, yielding two strains, EH13 and EHB3. A Southern blot analysis indicated that more than one cof1-101 allele was inserted in EH13, and a single cof1-101 was inserted in EHB3 (data not shown). EH13 cells lost their viability as determined by colony formation after a shift from 25 C to 37 C (Fig. 4). The loss of viability was delayed in the presence of 1 M sorbitol. The morphology of EH13 cells incubated at 37 C for 2 h was similar to that of cofilin-depleted cells (Figs 2A and 5B). Thick aggregates of actin filaments were observed in the cytoplasm of these cells (Fig. 5C). In vitro activities of the mutant cofilin on actin filaments Wild-type and mutant E1 (cof1­101)-cofilin, to which a 6×His tag was added at their C-termini, were expressed in E. coli and purified. Their activities on actin filaments were analysed by pelleting assay (Fig. 5D,E). As reported previously (Iida et al. 1993), wild-type yeast cofilin cosediments with polymerized actin at low pH and increases actin recovery in supernatant fractions at high pH. The effects of mutant E1-cofilin at pH 6.8 were slightly weaker than those of the wild-type (Fig. 5D). Actin depolymerization by E1-cofilin was reduced at

pH 8.3 as compared to the wild-type (Fig. 5E). However, the activities of E1-cofilin were not significantly altered at 37 C (data not shown). Isolation of a multicopy suppressor of the cofilin ts-mutation We screened a yeast multicopy genomic library for the isolation of plasmids that suppressed the temperature sensitivity of EH13. In addition to several plasmids harbouring COF1, we obtained one plasmid containing a 10-kb insert that expressed this suppressor activity and designated the responsible gene SCF1 (suppressor of cof1). Fragments of the insert were subcloned into a multicopy vector, after which their suppressor activity was determined (Fig. 6). Sequencing of the shortest active fragment (2.8 kb SalI-BglII) revealed that SCF1 is identical to the AIP1 gene, which had been cloned as an actin-interacting protein by the yeast two-hybrid screening system using the actin gene ACT1 as `bait' (Amberg et al. 1995). The SCF1/AIP1 on a multicopy plasmid partially, but significantly, suppressed the ts phenotype of EH13 (Fig. 7), but it did not rescue the lethality of Dcof1 (data not shown). Synthetic lethal interaction between cof1-101 and scf1/aip1 In agreement with a previous report (Amberg et al. 1995), gene disruption and tetrad analysis using a

diploid strain, KA31, showed that SCF1/AIP1 is nonessential for cell viability. To further examine the genetic interaction between COF1 and SCF1/AIP1, a

haploid Dscf1/aip1 strain, SL2 (MAT aip1D::LEU2) and EHB3 (MATa COF1 scf1/ cof1-101::HIS3

SCF1/AIP1) were mated, after which the tetrads of the resultant heterozygous diploid were analysed (Table 2). Out of 180 spores, only three formed colonies. The restriction map of the PCR-amplified cof1 DNA region indicated that the three viable spores were carrying COF1 in addition to cof1-101. These results indicate that a combination of Dscf1/aip1 and cof1-101 is synthetically lethal. To confirm this conclusion, we created a cof1-101-carrying strain EGS17, in which the expression of SCF1/AIP1 was controlled under the GAL7 promoter. EGS17 cells grew at 27 C on SGal plates but not on SGlc plates (Fig. 8).

Functional significance of WD40 repeats in Aip1 Since Aip1 is a member of the WD40 repeat protein family, we examined whether the domains of the WD40 repeat in Aip1 are functionally significant. Aip1 has eight WD40 repeats (Fig. 9A). Each of the 5th, 6th and 8th WD40 repeats of AIP1 were deleted and plasmids containing the deleted aip1 genes were separately introduced into cof1-101 cells. The intracellular content of Aip1 mutants was comparable to that of the wild-type Aip1 (Fig. 9B). None of the plasmids

We examined whether the distribution of actin and cofilin was altered in SHD1, a diploid strain of Dscf1/ aip1/Dscf1/aip1 and COF1/COF1. Staining of SHD1 cells with rhodamine phalloidin revealed that cortical actin patches were present normally in Dscf1/aip1 cells (data not shown), suggesting that Scf1/Aip1 is not an obligatory component of cortical actin patches. Interestingly, in SHD1 cells, cofilin was found to be distributed in long fibres as well as actin patches (Fig. 10D,E). These fibres appeared to be similar to, but more extensively developed than those stained with anti-actin antibodies in wild-type cells. The long fibres in SHD1 cells were not stained with either C4, a monoclonal antiactin antibody, nor with phalloidin.

EH13 cells which had been precultured at 25 C to 3.6 × 106 cells/mL in YPD medium (W) or to 4.5 × 106 cells/mL in YPD medium supplemented with 1 M sorbitol (A), were shifted to 37 C and cultured for 6 h at 37 C. Aliquots of each culture were picked up at the indicated times, briefly sonicated, diluted several fold, and plated on YPD plates or YPD plates supplemented with 1 M sorbitol. The colony numbers were counted after 4 days at 25 C. suppressed the ts-phenotype of cof1-101 cells (Fig. 9C), indicating that WD40 repeats in Aip1 are functionally significant in the suppression mechanism. Intracellular distribution of cofilin and Aip1 We examined the intracellular distribution of Aip1 by immunofluorescence microscopy using specific antibodies against recombinant Aip1. The distribution of Scf1/Aip1 could be superimposed on to that of cortical actin patches in a wild-type strain (Fig. 10A,B). As has been previously reported (Moon et al. 1993), cofilin is co-localized in cortical actin patches. Thus, both cofilin and Aip1 are co-localized in cortical actin patches in a wild-type strain.

Discussion Requirement of cofilin for cell growth Cofilin-depleted cells often contained a tiny bud and sometimes had divided nuclei in the mother cells. These results suggest that the growth of buds and normal nuclear division critically requires the functions of cofilin. The unusual distribution of phalloidin-stainable actin filaments was observed in cofilin-depleted cells. This is consistent with the observation that cofilin is necessary for the turnover of actin in yeast cells (Lappalainen & Drubin 1997). Phenotypes of a tscofilin mutant, cof1-101, under nonpermissive conditions are essentially the same as those of cofilin-depleted cells. The over-expression of cofilin resulted in a loss of viability in yeast cells (Fig. 1). This does not contradict our previous finding that Dictyostelium cells overexpressing cofilin sevenfold can divide several times or more (Aizawa et al. 1997). When cofilin was expressed several-fold in yeast cells harbouring a multicopy plasmid carrying COF1, these cells grew normally (unpublished observations). Temperature-sensitive mutations of cofilin In the present study, we applied random mutagenesis for isolation of ts-mutants of cofilin and isolated six independently mutated clones. Of these two sets of identical mutations were identified. Four different mutations showing ts-phenotype of growth were all mapped in the region close to a hypothesized actinbinding site (Hatanaka et al. 1996). The mutations of D3 (C1) and E1 are located at the end of -sheet, adjacent to the -helix. On the basis of the results from X-ray crystallography on yeast cofilin and actophorin--a cofilin homologue in Acanthamoeba--it was suggested

that the -helix was interrupted (Fedorov et al. 1997;

Leonard et al. 1997). We recently confirmed the presence of a similar distortion in porcine destrin (Hatanaka & Moriyama, unpublished results). The other two mutations, D1 (C3) and D2 were mapped in the interrupted sequence. Purified E1-cofilin (cof1101), which caused the greatest temperature effect, showed a relatively weak ability to depolymerize actin at pH 8.3. The temperature sensitivity of cof1-101 may be ascribed to this defect of E1-cofilin, although the other possibility remains to be excluded. Functions of Scf1/Aip1 The AIP1 gene was originally isolated as a gene that encoded a protein that interacts with actin in the twohybrid screening system (Amberg et al. 1995). The interaction of Aip1 with actin in the two-hybrid system was distinctively abolished by special mutation alleles of actin, suggesting that Aip1 might interact with actin in a

novel fashion in cytoskeletal systems (Amberg et al. 1995). The AIP1 gene encodes a protein containing eight WD40 repeats that are distributed in a variety of proteins and are thought to be involved in protein­ protein interactions (Neer et al. 1994). As shown above, deletion mutations of WD40 repeat regions caused a loss of the suppressing activity on phenotypes of tscofilin, suggesting that WD40 repeats are involved in actin­Aip1 interactions. This has been supported by our recent finding that these deletion mutants failed to interact with actin in the two-hybrid system (unpublished observations). We previously found that a novel 66-kDa protein (p66) was induced in Physarum polycephalum by heat shock in association with the process of cyst formation, and that p66 was an actin-binding protein (Shimada et al. 1992). Recently, p66 was identified as a homologue of Aip1 in this organism (Matsumoto et al. 1998). More recently still, Aip1 has been isolated as a protein which binds to Xenopus ADF/cofilin-glutathione-S-transferase

(Okada et al., personal communication). We have also isolated an Aip1 homologue from Dictyostelium discoideum (Aizawa et al., submitted). In both cases, the results showed that cofilin destroyed actin filaments more efficiently in vitro in the presence of Aip1 than in its absence. The results shown in Fig. 10 are intriguing in this regard, because thick and long fibrous structures stained with anti-cofilin antibody are present in Dscf1/ aip1 yeast cells but not in SCF1 cells. Although these fibrous structures were stained with neither phalloidin nor antiactin antibody C4, it is likely that they may be actin fibres decorated with cofilin. If so, the effects of cofilin on filamentous actin are restricted in Dscf1/aip1 cells. In conclusion, the present report demonstrated for the first time that cofilin and Aip1 are functionally related in the reorganization of actin structures in vivo. Experimental procedures Microbiological techniques The complex YPD and the synthetic minimal SD media were as previously described (Sherman et al. 1986).

5-fluoro-orotic acid (1 mg/mL) and uracil (20 mg/L) were used to eliminate URA3-carrying plasmids from yeast cells (Boeke et al. 1984). Yeast transformation was performed by electroporation (Becker & Guarente 1991).

Plasmid constructions Plasmid YCpYCS (URA3 CEN4) and YEpYCS (URA3 2 m ori), which carried the spliced-form COF1, were as described previously (Moriyama et al. 1996). Another COF1-carring plasmid, pRS-YCS, was constructed by inserting a 1.1 kb EcoRI-EcoRV fragment of the spliced-form COF1 into a HIS3-carrying centromere vector pRS313 (Sikorsky & Heater 1989). Plasmid YEpSCF was constructed by two-step insertion of a 1.8-kb SalI-PstI fragment and a 0.9 kb PstI-BglII fragment of SCF1/AIP1 between the SalI site and the BamHI site of a multicopy vector YEplac181 (LEU2) (Gietz & Sugino 1988). The plasmids for expression of cofilin and Scf1/Aip1 in E. coli

were constructed as follows. An NcoI site and a BamHI site were introduced by PCR amplification at the initiation codon and at 9 bp upstream of the stop codon, respectively, of the spliced-form COF1 and its E1 mutant, and then the 0.42 kb NcoI-BamHI fragments were inserted between the NcoI and BglII sites of an expression vector pQE60 (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The resultant plasmids pQE-YCS and pQE-E1 encode wild-type and mutant E1 cofilin, respectively, with a 6×His tag at the C-terminal. For SCF1/AIP1, which has an intrinsic XhoI site at 6 bp upstream of the stop codon, a 2.4 kb SalI-XhoI fragment was inserted into the SalI site of pUC19 (the SalI site is adjacent to the PstI site of the vector), an NcoI site was introduced by PCR amplification at the initiation codon, and then the 1.8 kb NcoI-BamHI fragment was inserted between the NcoI and BglII sites of pQE60 to create pQE-SCF. pQE-SCF encodes Scf1/Aip1, with 10 additional amino acid residues including a 6×His tag (SRGSHHHHHH) at the C-terminal. The second amino acid residues of both of the recombinant proteins were changed from Ser to Ala.

Yeast strains All the strains used in this study (Table 3) were derived from a wild-type strain KA31 (Irie et al. 1991). Strain LG1, in which the GAL1 promoter was inserted together with the LEU2 marker into the SnaBI site at 53 bp upstream of the initiation codon of COF1, was obtained by one-step gene replacement as follows. An 0.8 kb BamHI-EcoRI fragment of the GAL1 promoter was inserted into the 30-end of LEU2 in plasmid pJJ252 (Jones & Prakash 1990), and then a 2.8 kb XbaI-EcoRI fragment, which contained LEU2:GAL1p, was filled in and inserted in the correct direction into the SnaBI site of the spliced-form COF1 (1.2 kb EcoRI-SphI) in pUC19. A 3.7 kb HindIII-BalI fragment of the resultant plasmid was introduced into cells of a wild-type haploid strain KA311. Leuþ colonies were picked up, and their DNA were checked by PCR analysis. The selected strain was designated as LG1. A cof1-disrupted haploid strain L2A harbouring a COF1-carring plasmid YCpYCS, was segregated from a heterozygous diploid strain L2 (COF1/cof1D::LEU2) (Iida et al. 1993), which had been transfected with YCpYCS. A cofilin ts mutant strain EH13, which had cof1-101:HIS3 in place of COF1, was obtained as follows. A 1.4-kb EcoRI-SphI fragment of COF1 (with the intron) was subcloned into pUC19, and an 0.1 kb AseI-AflII fragment was replaced by the corresponding fragment of the E1 plasmid containing the mutation sites. A 1.7 kb HincII-SmaI fragment of the HIS3 gene in plasmid pJJ217 (Jones & Prakash 1990) was inserted into the EcoRV site at 0.38 kb downstream of the stop codon of cof1101 in the resultant plasmid, and then the DNA fragment from the stop codon to the EcoRV site was inserted into the 30-end of

A striped area is weakly homologous (22­24%) to Sec12. The 5th, 6th or 8th repeats were independently deleted. (B) Expression of WD40 repeat-deleted Scf1/ Aip1 proteins is comparable to that of the wild-type protein. (C) A multicopy plasmid carrying SCF1/AIP1, YEpSCF, suppressed the ts-phenotype of cof1-101 but those carrying WD40 repeat-deleted scf1/ aip1 mutants, D5, D6 or D8 did not.

the HIS3 gene to minimize the influence of HIS3 insertion on the downstream gene. A 3.3 kb SspI-SphI fragment of this cof1101:HIS3 construct was introduced into KA311 cells. Hisþ colonies that showed ts-phenotype were selected, and their DNA were checked by PCR analysis to confirm that wild-type COF1 was correctly replaced by mutant cof1-101. The selected strain was designated as EH13. Southern blotting analysis, however, indicated that more than one cof1-101 allele was inserted tandemly in EH13. Therefore, we created another mutant strain EHB3 with a single cof1-101 allele in place of COF1. In EHB3, HIS3 was inserted into the BalI site at 0.24 kb downstream of the stop codon. A homozygous diploid strain EH13D was obtained by transforming EH13 cells with plasmid 43A carrying the HO gene (Harashima et al. 1984). SCF1/AIP1disrupted strains were obtained as follows. The SCF1/AIP1 gene in YEpSCF was transferred to pUC19, and its 2.0 kb BglII-XhoI fragment, containing the entire coding region, was deleted and replaced by LEU2 (a 2.0 kb BamHI-SalI fragment of plasmid pJJ250) or HIS3 (a 1.3 kb BamHI-XhoI fragment of plasmid pJJ217). The SalI-SacI fragments of the resultant plasmids were separately introduced into cells of a wild-type diploid strain KA31. Leuþ or Hisþ transformants were picked up, and their DNA were checked by PCR. SCF1/AIP1-disrupted haploid strains SL2, SH1 and SH4 were segregated from the resultant heterozygous diploids. A homozygous diploid strain SHD1 was obtained by mating SH1 and SH4 cells. Strains KGS1 and EGS17, in which the GAL7 promoter was inserted together with the URA3 marker at the initiation codon of SCF1/AIP1, were obtained as follows. A 1.8 kb EcoRI-BglII fragment of plasmid pAA7 containing URA3:GAL7p (Matsui & Toh-e 1992), was filled-in and inserted in the correct direction into the NcoI site at the initiation codon of SCF1/AIP1 in pUC19. A 2.9 kb SphIXbaI fragment of the resultant plasmid containing a 1.1-kb SalIXbaI fragment of SCF1/AIP1 with a 1.8 kb insertion of URA3:GAL7p, was introduced into KA311 or EHB3 cells. The transfected cells were grown on SGal plates at 25 C. Uraþ colonies were picked up, and their DNA were checked by PCR analysis. Hydroxylamine mutagenesis and screening of ts mutants pRS-YCS DNA (10 g) was treated with 1 M hydroxylamine in 50 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.0 for 20­100 min at 75 C, and then recovered by ethanol precipitation (Schauer et al. 1985). Aliquots of 1 g of the mutagenized DNA were separately introduced into L2A cells by electroporation. Hisþ Uraþ colonies were replicated on SD plates containing 5-fluoro-orotic acid (1 mg/mL) and uracil (20 mg/L) to eliminate the wild-type COF1-carrying plasmid and incubated for several days at 25 C. Then, Hisþ Ura­ colonies which were unable to grow at 37 C were selected.

Purification of the recombinant cofilin and Scf1/Aip1 from E. coli The 6×His-tagged proteins were purified using Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as described previously (Moriyama et al. 1996) from E. coli BL21(Rep4) cells transfected with pQE-YCS, pQE-E1 or pQE-SCF. Wild-type or mutant E1 cofilin was induced with 2 mM IPTG for 16 h at 30 C to minimize protein denaturation. Scf1/Aip1 was induced with 2 mM IPTG for 5 h at 37 C. E. coli cell lysates were prepared by treating cells with lysozyme and detergent as previously described (Sambrook et al. 1989). Briefly, the cell suspensions in three volumes of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 20 g/mL aprotinine, 2 g/mL leupeptine, pH 8.0) were incubated first with lysozyme (final 0.2 mg/mL) for 20 min at 4 C, and with deoxycholic acid (final 1 mg/mL) for 5 min at 20 C, and then briefly sonicated. All the recombinant proteins were purified with the Ni-NTA resin at nondenaturing conditions from the supernatant fractions of the lysates, although a significant proportion of Scf1/Aip1 was recovered in the pellet fraction. Pelleting assay The abilities of the purified cofilin to bind to and to depolymerize F-actin were assessed by the pelleting assay (Yonezawa et al. 1988; Moriyama et al. 1996) with minor 40 L of polymerization buffer (50 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 6.8 or 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.02 mM ATP, 0.5 mg/mL BSA),

Screening of multicopy suppressors of the cofilin ts mutation EH13 cells were transfected with a yeast multicopy genomic library constructed on YEp13. The transfected cells were incubated overnight at 25 C and then for 4­6 days at 35 C. Plasmids were recovered from the colonies, which could grow at 35 C, and their suppressor activities were checked by retransfection. One positive plasmid with a 10-kb insert was obtained. Various portions of the insert were subcloned into a multicopy vector YEplac181, and their suppressor activities were tested.

Preparation of antibodies An antiserum against yeast cofilin was obtained from a rabbit immunized with a BSA-coupled synthetic oligopeptide corresponding to the C-terminal 12 amino acids (VLQRVSRGAGSH) of yeast cofilin. An antiserum against Scf1/Aip1 was obtained from a rabbit immunized with the purified recombinant Scf1/Aip1. Specific antibodies were purified from the antisera by affinity chromatography. The specificity of the antibodies was checked by immunoblotting of yeast crude lysate, as described previously (Moriyama et al. 1996). Peroxidase-conjugated goat IgG fraction against rabbit IgG (Cappel/Organon Technika, Malvern, PA) was used as the second antibody. O-dianishidine (0.01%) and 4-chloro-1naphthol (0.003%) in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5), 0.01% H2O2 were used as substrates.

Immunofluorescence methods Immunofluorescence staining of yeast cells was performed by the method of Pringle et al. (1991). For staining of cofilin, the spheroplasts attached on poly-L-lysine-coated slide glasses were treated briefly with cold (­20 C) methanol and acetone. Monoclonal antiactin antibody C4 was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim Biochemica. FITC-conjugated affinitypurified goat IgG against rabbit IgG (Cappel/Organon Technika, Malvern, PA) was used as the second antibody. Staining with rhodamine-phalloidin (Sigma Co., St Louis, MO) was performed as described by Adams & Pringle (1991).
