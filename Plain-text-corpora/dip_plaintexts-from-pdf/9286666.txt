Nancy M.Hollingsworth and Lisa Ponte Department of Biochemistly and Cell Biology, State University of Neu York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, New York 11 794-5215 Manuscript received January6, 1997 Accepted for publication May 19, 1997 ABSTRACT During meiosis, axial elements are generatedby the condensationof sister chromatids alonga protein core as precursors to the formationof the synaptonemal complex (X). Functional axial elements are essential for wild-type levelsof recombination and proper reductional segregation atmeiosis I. Genetic and cytological data suggest that three meiosis-specific genes, HOPI, REDl and MEKI, are involvedin axial element formation in the yeast Saccharomycescermisiae. HOPl and RED1 encode structural components of axial elementswhile MEKl encodesa putative protein kinase. Usingapartially functional allele of A4EK1, new genetic interactions have been found between HOPl, REDl and MEKl. Overexpression of HOPl partiallysuppressesthesporeinviabilityandrecombinationdefects of mekl-974; in contrast, overexpressionof REDl exacerbatesthe mekl-974spore inviability. Co-overexpression of HOPl and RED1 in mekl-974 diploids alleviates the negative effect of overexpressing RED1 alone.Redlp/Redlp as well as Hoplp/Redlp interactionshave been reconstituted in two hybrid experiments. Our results suggest a modelwherebyMeklkinaseactivity controlsaxialelementassembly by regulatingtheaffinity with which Hoplp and Redlp interact with each other.

EIOSISis a specialized typeof cell division in ally reproducing organisms is reduced by half. A complex, tightly coordinated series of events ensures that each gamete receives one member of each pair of homologous chromosomes(forrecent reviews see OMWEAVER1995; ROEDER1995; KLECKNER 1996). Fusion of haploid gametes then reconstitutes the diploid chromosome number of the organism. A reduction in chromosome number is achieved during meiosis by having two rounds of chromosome segregation followa single round of DNA replication. At the first meiotic division (MI),homologous pairs of sister chromatids segregate to oppositepoles. This division is unique to meiosis and is responsible forseparatingthe homologues so that every gamete receives one member of each pair. The second meiotic division (MII) resembles mitosis in that sister chromatids disjoin to opposite poles. Studies in a wide variety of organisms have demonstrated that for chromosomes to segregate properly at the first meiotic division, the replicated homologues must be physically connected by crossovers formed between non-sister chromatids. Theseconnectionsare attached in the proper orientation to the MI spindle. In the absence of this connection,the chromosomes Curresponding authm: NancyHollingsworth,Department of Biochemistryand Cell Biology, SUNY Stony Brook,Stony Brook, NY 117945215.

which the diploid chromosome numberof sexu-

necessary forhomologues the to become stably

segregate randomly. As a result, high levels ofchromosome nondisjunction occur,thereby creating aneuploid gametes. These chromosomal imbalances often cause the production of inviable or abnormal zygotes. The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a highly conservedmeiosis-specific multiproteinstructureformed when homologous chromosomes synapse (VONWEITSTEIN et al. 1984;MOENS 1994;HEY~INC 1996).SC formation begins by the condensation of sister chromatids upon a protein coreto form axial elements and is completed by the insertion of a central region, which includes a number of transverse filaments. Genetic studies in a varietyofsystemshaveshown that for crossovers to be effective in disjunction, axial elementsmust form and be connected atvariouspoints; thecentralregion, however, is not required(see below).Correlativedata suggestinga relationshipbetween SCformation and crossingovercomesfrom the analysis of meiotic mutants in tomato, which affect SC formation to varying degrees. A strong correlation has been seen between thenumber of homologues connected by at least one stretch of SC in these mutants and the number of homologuesconnected by chiasmata at metaphaseI (~VEKESet al. 1994). Mutations in two yeast genes encodingstructuralcomponents of axial elements, HOPI and R H l I , eliminate SC formation while stillexhibiting residual levels ofmeiotic recombiand BYERS 1989; ROCKMILLand

ROEDER1990;MAO-DRAYERal. 1996).Since the spore et viability of these mutants is <1%, the same as for mutants such as spoll, which completelyabolish recombination (KLAF'HOLZ et al. 1985), thecrossoversoccurring in hop1 and redl mutants are apparently not effective in disjunction. Further evidence supporting this idea was obtained by ROCKMILLand ROEDER(1990) who demonstrated that nondisjoined chromosomes in redl mutants had undergone significant levels of crossing over; therefore the connection that was formed in the absence ofSCwas not sufficient to properly segregate the homologues at MI. ENGEBRECHTal. (1990) examet ined nondisjoined chromosomes in a meiotic mutant merl, which reduces meiotic recombination to -10% the levelof wild type.Mer1 diploidsform extended axial elements, but very little SC (ENGEBRECHT and ROEDER 1990). As with redl, nondisjoined chromosomes contained a significant number ofcrossovers.Overexpression of a second gene, MER2, suppresses the rnerl defect in SC formation butnot in the frequency of crossing over. In this strain, nondisjoined homologues showed a decreased amount of recombination (ENGEL BRECHT et al. 1990), demonstrating that crossovers occurring in the presence of SC promote proper MI disjunction. A number of models have been proposed to explain the requirement ofSC formation for proper disjunction. MAGUIRE (1995) has proposed that the presence of SC during prophaseis necessaryfor sisterchromatid cohesion at MI. In support of this hypothesis,a lateral elementcomponent from hamsters, Corl, has been found to be presentbetween sister chromatids at metaphase I (DOBSON et al. 1994).The release of sisterchromatid cohesion occurs at the same time that the Corl protein is lost from the chromosomes, suggesting a causalrelationship between the two (MOENSand SPYROPOULOS 1995). It is also possible that remnants of the SC remain after the bulk of the SC has disassembledto directly stabilize the chiasmata-an idea supported by the observation of SC components at the site of chiasmata post diplotene (VON WETTSTEIN et a[. 1984). To understand how the SC functions in meiosis, it is necessary to define the protein components that comprise the SC and to characterize their functions. In recent years great progress has been made in the identification of meiosis-specificprotein componentsof either axial (lateral) or central elements inyeast and mammals. Ziplp and SCPl are transverse filaments of the central region ofyeastand mammalian SCs, respectively (MEUWISSENet al. 1992;SYM and ROEDER1995). Indiploids deleted for ZIPl, axial elements are able to form, alignwith one another and are connected at various points along the lengths of the chromosomes in a ho-

over and spore viability, full synapsismust not be required for substantial recombination and the promotion of proper MI disjunction. This result points to formation andconnection ofaxial elements as the key elements for generating segregation-competent crossovers. Lateral (axial) element componentshave been identified in mammals, plants and yeast (ANDERSON et al. 1994; ROEDER1995;HEWING1996). In terms of function, analysisof HOPl and REDl hasbeen most informative due to the availabilityof genetic analysis inSaccham myes cerevisiae. HOPl and REDl are not required for intrachromosomal recombination (HOLLINGSWORTH and BYERS1989; ROCKMILLand ROEDER1990; MAODRAYER al. 1996).This result and the fact that hopl et mutants show an increased number of intersisterjoint molecules relative to wild type has led to the idea that one function of HOPl is to promote interhomologue interactions ( S C H W A C ~ KLECKNER 1994).Hop1 and and Red1 proteins localize to meiotic chromosomes andmore specifically to axial elements (HOLLINGS WORTH et al. 1990; SMITH and ROEDER1997; F. KLEIN and B. BYERS,personal communication). This result is consistentwith a numberof genetic results that suggest that HOPl and W 1function in the same pathway and may physically interact. In addition to the phenotypic similarities described above, HOPl and REDl were placed in the same genetic epistasisgroup by ROCKMILL and ROEDER(1990). The fact that overexpression of IzEDl showsallele-specific suppression of a missense mutation located near the endof the Hop1protein has led to the hypothesis that Redlp physically interacts with the Hoplp carboxy terminus (HOLLINGSWORTH and JOHNSON 1993;FRIEDMAN et al. 1994). All these experiments suggest that Hoplp and Redlp assemble together to form axial elements in yeast. A third gene,M E K I , has alsobeen shown genetically to act in the same pathwayas HOPl and REDl. MEKl (also knownas MRE4) encodes a meiosis-specific protein with strong homology to serine/threonine protein kinases (ROCKMILLand ROEDER1991;LEEMand OGAWA 1992).Like hop1 and redl mutants, mekl strains exhibit residual levels of interhomologue recombination but are fully proficient in intrachromosomal crossing over (ROCKMILLand ROEDER1991; HOLLINCSWORTHal. et 1995). A major difference between MEKl and HOPI/ REDl is that m k l mutants form SC (althoughthe stretches appear shorter thanwild type). The defect in spore viability is not as severe for mekl diploids (15%), despite a reduced level of crossing over similar to that observed in hopl and redl mutants (ROCKMILLand ROEDER1991).This observation is consistent with the idea that crossoversoccurring even in the presence of

mology-dependent fashion (SYMet al. 1993;ROCKMILL potentially aberrant SC are better at promotingMI dis-

et al. 1995). Since the absence of thecentral region results in only a modest twofold reduction in crossing junctionthan those occurring in the absence of SC. The genetic interactions and phenotypic similarities be-

tween HOPl and REDl, two structural components of axial elements, and MEKl, a putative protein kinase, suggest the hypothesis that MEKl mayplay a role in regulating axial element formation in yeast. To test this hypothesis, we have taken advantage of a partially functional allele of MEKl, mekl-974,to investigate further genetic interactions between MEKl, HOPl and RED1. Our data indicate that thestoichiometryof Hop1 and Red1 proteins is critical for forming functional axial elements. The proper stoichiometry is achieved presumably by regulating the affinities between Hoplp/Redlp,Hoplp/HoplpandRedlp/ Redlp. Thegenetic interactions we observe when overexpressing HOPl or REDl in the mekl-974 background suggesta role for MEKl in regulating the stoichiometry

An isogenic diploid, NH162, was constructed by crossing 2273-1-2Amekl with a9-741/20-5, the MATa derivativefrom the disomic haploid 9-74 that contains the mekl-974 mutation (HOLLINGSWORTH et al. 1995).The MATa haploid derivative of9-74was backcrossed three times into the A364Abackground to obtain the strain NH87-17-4FOA'. NH87-174FOA' was crossed to a9-741/20-5 to generate NH104and to akarC24/20-5 to generate the isogenic diploid NH107. Both MATa strains used in these crosses have pNH20-5 integrated at the spol3 locus, thereby converting the strains to SPO13/TRpI (HOLLINGSWORTHand BYERS1989).NH173 was constructed by crossing NH87-17-4 to a9-741. Plasmid construction: Plasmids for thisstudywere made by standard procedures (MANIATISet al. 1982)using the Escherichia coli strain BSJ72. To construct the meklAADE2 deletion allele, the PCRwas used to generate a fragment of ADE2 with SacI and PVuII ends. The oligonucleotides used in the PCR reaction wereAde2-Sac(5'GACAGATAAAATTTAAGA GCTCTTAAATATTAGTGAGAAGCCGAG3')andAde2-PvuII (5'ATCATTTTATAATTATCAGCTGTACAAGTATATCAAT AAAC3').

STERNGLANZ, State UniversityofNewYork (SUNY),Stony Brook] at the BamHI site to generate pNH207. This plasmid encodes a full-length protein capable of complementing the red1 spore inviability defect (data not shown).To construct the GAD-HOP1fusion plasmid, oligonucleotide sitedirected mutagenesis (SMITH 1985) was usedto introduce a BamHI siteimmediatelyupstream of the ATGaswellasto make a silent mutation that destroys the BamHI site within the HOPl gene.

ble to the15.3% (93asci) spore viability observed for an isogenic diploid (NH114) deleted forMEKI. Second, a diploid homozygous for mekl-974 (NH104) is complemented by MEKl on aplasmid(Table 2). The mekl974 mutant decreasesspore viability to 57.2%, suggesting that the mutant protein is partially functional. In contrast to the deletion inwhich few spores areviable, the level of spore viability conferred by mekl-974 enables one toanalyze the distributionof viable spores in tetrads.The mekI-974diploid NH104 shows an excess of two- and zero-viable spore tetrads at the expense of four-viable spore tetrads compared to NH104 carrying the A4EKl gene on a plasmid (Figure 1).This pattern of sporeviability is often indicative of meiosis I nondisjunction where the two-viable spore tetrads result from nondigunction of one or more homologues tosame the pole and the zero-viable spore tetrads result when two or more different chromosomes nondisjoin opposite to poles. Further evidence that meiosis I nondisjunction is occurring in the mekl-974 strain is the bias toward sister spores in tetrads with only two viable spores. If spore

death is random then the numberof sister spores(+/

or -/-)

+

for a tightly centromere-linked marker should

equal the number of non-sister spores (+/-) . In contrast,meiosisI nondisjunction results in the death of the two sister spores that are lacking the missegregated chromosome and the survival of the two sisterspores containing the disomic chromosome, thereby creating NH104, 68.7% (64 asci) and 70% (67 asci) of the twoviable sporetetradscontained sister sporesforthe tightly centromere-linked markers, CDClOand SPOl?, respectively. Both values are statistically significantly different from the50% value predicted by random spore A number of meiotic mutants result inmeiosis I nondisjunction becauseof a defect in crossingover between homologues.Deletionof MEKl has previously been shown to reduce recombination between homologues to -10% the level of wild type (ROCKMILL and ROEDER 1991).To determine whether themekl-974 mutant also reduces recombination between homologous chromosomes, a mekl-974 st013 homozygous diploid (NH173) that is isogenic to NH104 was constructed. Because with a single division crossovers are no longer necessary to produce viable spores,recombination-defectivemutantscontaining spol? produce viable sporecolonies that can then be analyzed for crossing over (MALONE and ESPOSITO1981). The NH173 diploid was sporulated and the resulting dyads analyzed for recombination in three intervals on chromosome 111.The mapdistances for these intervals were compared to those obtained from the same strain complemented by a plasmid carrying MEKl. A reduction in recombination was observed in NH173 for all

an excess of +/+ and -/- two viable-spore tetrads. In

three intervals with recombination in the mutant ranging from 8.6-1.5.8% of wild type (Table 3). The dccrease in spore viability observed for mrk1-9i4 is therefore likely due to the decrease in crossing over. Both the spore inviability and recombination defective phenotypesof mekl-974canbe partially suppressed by overexpressionof HOPI: The 57.2% spore viability conferred by rnrhl-974provides a useful tool for looking at genetic interactionswith other meiotic genes. NH104 was transformed with a high-copv plasmid containing the IfOI'1 gene to see whetheroverexpression of HOPI has any effect on sporeviability and/or recombination in the presence of mrlrl-974. Spore viability was assayed both by random sporeanalysis antl by dissection of tetrads. Both assays demonstrated that overexpression of HOPI improves thespore viability of the mrl{1-9f4 S1'013 diploid (.57.2-7.5.0%) (Table 2). Furthermore, thedistribution of viable spores in tetrads is shifted such that the numberof tetrads in which no spores are viable is decreased and the numberof tctrads in which four spores are viable is increased (Figure 1). In addition, the presence ofexcessHOPI reduced CDCIOsister spores in two-viable spore asci from 68.7% (64 asci) to 45.6% (46 asci) and SP013sister spores from 70% (Gf asci) to S.5.4% (48 asci). Increasing the dosage of HOPI is thereforeable to compensate,at least in pxt, for reduced Meklp function. Recombination was assayed in the md<1-974sp013diploid NH1f S transformed with the high-copy HOPI plasmid. Consistent with the spore viability data, map distanccs were increased h4o-to ninefold by the presence of excess HOPI in a11 three intervals (Table3). Overexpression of HOPI therefore improves the ability of the mrkl-Yi4 diploid to undergo crossing over on chromosome 111. These data suggest that the increasein crossing over and consequent improvementin chromosome disjunction at the first meiotic division are responsible

for the improved spore viability obsemed when HOI'I is overexpressed.

[In contrast, overexpression of RED1 in the isogenic MEKl strain NH107 has no effect on spore viability (91.5%, 50 asci)],The quantitative value for RED1 in NH104 is probably an underestimate given that only 21.0-35.7% of the asci that produced at least one viable sporecontainedthe plasmid. The bias against the presence of 2pREDl is not dueto plasmid instability during vegetative growth (Table 2). Instead it appearsthat overexpression of RED1 in the presence of mkl-974decreases the probabilityof forming four-spore asci. As a consequence,many of the tetrads that aredissected are derived from those rare cells that did not contain theplasmid at the startof meiosis. The distribution of viable spores in tetrads in the presence ofexcess RED1 shows a large reduction in the number of four-viablespore tetrads with a corresponding increase in the numberof zero-viablespore tetrads comparedto NH104with vector alone-a result expected if meiosis I nondidunction is occurring more frequently (Figure 1). Recombination in NH173was monitored in the presence of excess REDl. In twoof the three intervals assayed on chromosome 111,a reductionin map distance was observed,although this reduction is not statistically significant (Table 3).We believe that it is likelythat the reduction in spore viabilityinNH104 by excess RlDl is due to a furtherdecrease in interhomologue recombination, butour data do not rule outalternative possibilities. Co-overexpression ofHOPl and D l in a mekl-974 diploidrelievesthenegative effect of REDl: To test whether co-overexpressingHOPl and REDl could ameliorate the RED1 negative effect, the REDl gene was expressed either separately or together with the HOPl gene in the mekl-974 diploid NH104. To coexpress the genes, the HOPl gene was cloned into theplasmid containing RED1 (pNH218) to create pNH219 (seeMATERI-

ALS AND METHODS). The sporulatedcells weretested for

spore viability by tetrad dissection and the number of viable spores observed was similar to the numberwhen the vector alone is present (Table 2).Furthermore, the pattern of viable spores in tetrads resemblesthe pattern of NH104 containing YEp24 (Figure 1). Overexpressionof HOPl suppresses amekl deletion diploid The effectsof overexpressingHOPl or REDl inadeletion of MEKl were tested by transforming NH114 with the appropriate plasmids, sporulating the cells and dissecting tetrads. In the presence of the vector YCp50, 12.5% (80asci) spore viabilitywas observed. Overexpression of HOPl (pNH83) increased spore viability to 26.3% (93 asci) while overexpression of REDl (plb-1) had no effect (9.1%,82 asci). The HOPl supHop1andRed1proteinsinteractbothwiththemselves andwitheachother: To test for Redlp/Redlp and Hoplp/Redlpprotein interactions, we performed reconstruction experiments using the yeast two hybrid system (FIELDSand STERNGLANZ 1994).Both full-length RED1 and HOPl genes were fused to the k d DNA bindingdomain from E. coli. In addition full-length HOPl was fused to the GAL4activation domain (GAD). We were unable to clonethe full length RED1 gene into pGAD2F perhaps because the fusion in this vector is toxic in E. coli (L. PONTE,unpublished results). ACterminal fusion of RlD1 to GAD (GAD-RED1537.x27)was generously provided to us by M. CARLSON (Columbia University). Variouscombinations of the lexA and GAD plasmidswere cotransformed intothe two-hybrid reporter strain TAT7. TAT7 contains the lucZ gene with l e d binding sites upstream of the promoter. Proteinprotein interactions are indicated by the presence of P-galactosidase activity, whichwas detected usinga filter assay (see MATERIALS AND METHODS). A strong interaction (asindicated by the rapiditywith whichthe patches turnedblue) was observedbetween full-length ZedREDl and the Gterminal290 amino acids of RED1 (Table 4). Structural prediction programs indicate that the

pression is statisticallysignificant (x2,P < 0.001).

C-terminal Redlp domain mostlikely forms a coiled coil structure, a motifknown to mediate protein-protein interactions (LUPASet al. 1991).A positive signal, albeit weaker, was also observed between full-length kd-RED1 and GAD-HOP1 (Table 4). To define further thedomain of Redlp that interacts with Hoplp, the GAD-RlD1537.827 fusion was tested with full-length ledHOPl. This combination also gave a positive signal of approximately the same strength as full-length RlDl. ThereforetheGterminalthird of Redlp appears to promote interaction of Redlp not only with itself but also with Hoplp. We were not able to detect an interaction between Hopl molecules using the two-hybrid system.It is possible thatthe negative result in thistwo-hybrid experiment is due to a limitation of the assay.The fusions of lexA and GAD arebothtotheamino terminal part of the Hopl proteinand it is possible this is where homodimerization between Hopl molecules occurs. DISCUSSION A model for axial element formation during meiosis in yeast: The idea thatthe stoichiometry between Redlp and Hoplp is important for assembling functional axial elements first arose from the observation by FRIEDMANal. (1994) that overexpression of RED1 et has a negative effect on spore viability in diploids that are limiting for the amountof Hoplp. We have shown that a similar effect can be obtained not by limiting Hoplp directly, but by using a leaky allele of MEKl, mekl-974. These results, in addition to the observation that HOPl overexpression can partially suppress the recombination and spore viability defects of wkl-974, lead us to propose the following model: to assemble a fullyfunctional axial element, Hopl and Redlproteins must interact in a very precise stoichiometry (Figure 2A).The properstoichiometryis ensured by phosphorylation of Hoplp by Meklp, thereby creating a Hopl

molecule with high affinity for Redlp. In the absence of MEKl, the tendency for Redlp to self-assemblewill not be counterbalanced by the presence of phosphorylated Hoplp.As a result, the structure thatis assembled isgrossly imbalanced for Hoplp and Redlp (Figure 2B).With the partially functional mekl-974allele,a sub set of the Hopl protein is phosphorylated. Since some Hopl protein with high affinityfor Redlp is now available, the stoichiometry between Hoplp and Redlp is improved relative to the MEKl deletion with a consequent increase in crossingover and disjunction (Figure 2C). Overexpression of HOPl in the presence of mekl974 increases the total amount of Hoplp relative to Redlp as wellas increasing the amountof substrate for the leakyMeklp kinase.The imbalancebetween Hoplp and Redlp is therefore decreased even further (Figure 2D), and an even greater amount of interhomologue recombination and proper chromosome segregation is observed. Incontrast, overexpression of REDl in the presence of partially phosphorylated Hopl increases the imbalance between the two proteins (Figure 2E), producing a further decrease in crossing over and increased nondisjunction. Although the model presented specifically statesthat Hopl is the substrate of Meklp, alternative models in which Redlp is the substrate are also possible. For example, it may be that phosphorylation of Redlp decreasesthe affinity ofRedlp for itself,therebyindirectly promotingthe Redlp/Hoplp interaction. In thisregard it is interesting to note that the Gterminal part of REDl was obtained in a two-hybrid screen using a phosphatase (GLC7) as the target (TUet al. 1996). In contrast, kd-Glc7and GAD-HOP1do notinteract (data not shown). One role of GLC7duringmeiosistherefore may be to remove phosphate groups from Redlp, perhaps to promote disassemblyof the SC. The requirement for GLC7activityduring meiosis mustnot belimited to Redlp, however, since glc7mutants are able to proceed beyond the first meiotic division but fail to sporulate (NEIGEBORN and CARLSON 1987;M. CARLSON, personal communication). A strong prediction of this model is that co-overexpression of REDl and HOPl should restore the balance between the two proteinsand improve the level ofspore viability comparedtothe levelobservedwhen RED1 alone is overexpressed. This result was observed, indicating it is the ratio between the amountof Hopl and Redl proteins in the cell that is critical. This model for axial element assembly is based on the idea thatHopl and Redlproteins can interact not only with each other butalso with themselves and that it is the balance between these three different types of protein-protein interactions that is crucial to making functional axial elements. Genetic evidence exists for both Hopl/HoplandHopl/Redl protein interactions. Intragenic complementation has been observed

FIGURE2.-Models for how Hoplp and Redlp might assemble together to lorm axial elements in varioussituations. 0, Hoplp; 0,Redlp; and 0, phosphate groups. The stoichiometryof Redlpto Hoplp shown is arbitrary and not meant to imply an actualratio.

between different mutant alleles of HOPI (AJIMURAet al. 1993;FRIEDMANal. 1994). One interpretation of et this result is that the Hopl protein interact.. with itself. Two experiments had previously suggested that Hopl and Red1 proteins mightdirectlyinteract. First,overexpression of REBl specificallysuppresses a temperaturesensitive mutation of HOPI (HOLLINGSWORTHand JOHNSON 1993) and, second, Hoplp and Redlp have been shown to colocalize during axial element formation (SMITHand ROEDER 1997).Two-hybridreconstruction experiments presented here point more firmly to a direct interaction between Redlp and Hoplp.Since both HOP1 and REBl are meiosis-specific genes and the two-hybrid assay occurs in vegetative cells, it is unlikely that this interaction is being bridged by a third protein,although these experiments do not rule out this possibility. The two-hybrid experiments also demonstrated that Redlp molecules are able to interact with each other, consistent with the idea that Redlp monomers canself assemble in vivo. Both Hoplp and Redlpinteract with the same Cterminal 297 amino acids of Redlp, suggesting that binding of Redlp by Hoplp may compete for binding by other Redlp molecules and vice versa. Although no interaction between Hopl proteins was detected in the two-hybrid reconstruction experiments, biochemical evidence suggests that homodimerization of Hopl proteins can occur (N. HOLLINGSWORTH,unpublished data). The importance of protein stoichiometry in building macromolecularstructures has been elegantly elucidated in experiments studying T4 phage morphogenesis (WOOD 1980).Starting with ambermutations in genes encoding major structuralcomponents of T4 (e.6, gene 37, a major tail fiber gene or gene 23, a major component of the prehead shell),which reduce the amount of active protein present in infected cells FLOOR(1970),isolated second site suppressors that allowed phage growth. Hefoundthat these mutations mapped to genesencodingother structural componentsthat assembled with theproduct of the suppressed gene. Furthermore, thesuppressing mutations reducedtheamount of the second protein as well. These observations led to the "balance of components hypothesis." One partof this hypothesis postulates that if one component is limiting, the rate ofassemblyis slowedsuch that alternative aberrant pathways of assembly can occur instead. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that lowering the amountof p23 results in theformation of petiteratherthan normal sized phage heads (SHOWEand ONORATO 1978). These authors further showed that simultaneously reducing the amount of p24, a protein that coassembleswith p23, decreased the percentage of petite heads, demonstrating thatit is a balanced stoichiometryas opposed to an absolute amount of protein thatis necessaryfor proper assembly. We propose thataxial element assemblyduring meiosis isanalogous to phage morphogenesis. The fact that axial element-like structures are observed in hqhl mutants (LOIDLet al. 1994;SMITHand ROEDER1997) suggeststhat Redlp iscapable of self-assemblyduring meiosis in the absence of Hoplp. The low spore viability and reduced levels of recombination observed in hqbl strains indicate that these structures are nonfunctional, however (HOLLINGSWORTHand BYERS1989). We further suggestthat the shortened stretchesofSCobserved in mekl mutants arederived from the aberrantly assembled axial elements formed because the unphosphorylated Hopl protein is not efficient in counteracting


AssemblyElement Axial the tendency for Redlp to self-assemble.The lowered amount of recombination and spore viability in mkl mutants strongly suggests that the assembled SCis abnormal (ROCKMILLand ROEDER1991;LEEMand OGAWA 1992). Our model proposes that thestoichiometryof Hoplp and Redlp assembly into axial elements is modulated by the action of the Meklp kinase.If true,thenthe kinase activityof Meklp should be essential for its meiotic function. A point mutation in the kinase catalytic domain that greatly reduces kinase activity in vitrocreates a null allele of MEKl in vivo (T. DE LOS SANTOS and N. HOLLINGSWORTH,unpublished results). The ideathat phosphorylation of one proteincan enhancebinding to otherproteins has many precedents. For example, when yeast cells are stimulated by mating pheromone, the cells arrest at the GI stage of the cellcycle. This arrest is dependentonthe Far1 protein (CHANG and HERSKOWITZ1990). PETER et al. (1993) have shownthat Farlp is phosphorylated by the Fus3p kinase after stimulation with pheromoneand that it is this phosphorylation event which enables Farlp to bind to the Cdc28pCln2pcomplex and inactivate it, thereby preventing progression through thecell cycle. SH2 domains and their interactions with various receptor protein tyrosine kinases are also mediated by phosphorylation (reviewed in KOCH et al. 1991). SH2 domains consist of -100 amino acids and are foundin a numberof proteins. SH2domainshavebeen shown to mediate protein-protein interactions between the SH2containingprotein and tyrosine-phosphorylated polypeptides. For example, addition of epidermal growth factor induces the epidermal growth factor receptor to undergo autophosphorylation. As a result, the tyrosine phosphorylated regions of the receptor are converted into high-affinitybinding sitesfor proteins that contain SH2 domains. The mechanism proposed here foraxial element assemblymay be conservedin other eukaryotes.LAMMEIS et al. (1995) have shownthat amajor structural component of rat lateral elements, SCP3,is phosphorylated at early pachytene. Like Redlp, SCPS is a meiosis-specific proteinpredicted to form extensive coiledcoil structures attheCterminus ( L A " E R S et al. 1994). It is tempting tospeculate, therefore, thatSCP3phosphorylation may be important for obtaining the appropriate stoichiometry of SCPS and other lateral element componentsduring assemblyofaxial elements. Interestingly, the phosphorylation pattern of SCPS is dynamic, with the pattern of phosphorylation changing between early and midpachytene (LAMMEIS et al. 1995).It is therefore possible that phosphorylation playsa role not only in the assemblyofaxial elements but in other meiotic processes as well. Recentlyit has been proposed that one role for MEKl and RED1 in the cell is to provide the chromosomal context forrecombination inter-

in Yeast 41

mediates so that theirprogression during prophasecan be monitored (XU et al. 1997). In summary,we have shown that the relative dosage of Redl and Hopl proteins is important for wild-type levels of crossing over and spore viability.We attribute this dosage effect to therequirementfora balanced stoichiometry between Hopl and Redl proteins in the formation of functional axial elements during meiosis in the budding yeast S. cerarisiae. Genetic interactions with a leaky allele of the meiosis-specifickinase, MEKl, further suggest that Hoplp/Redlp stoichiometry may be regulated by phosphorylation of one of these proteins by Meklp. In supportof this model, we have demonstrated thatRedlp interacts physicallyboth with itself and Hoplp. Furtherexperiments to determine whether Hoplp or Redlp areMeklp-dependentphosphoproteins are currently underway.
