of each competing axon was obtained with IP Lab software (Scanalytics, Fairfax, VA). The particular shape of the junction will influence this measure to some degree. For hemicircles that approximate the shapes of competing axon terminals, values 0.39 indicate that the regions are completely segregated. 9. Because of the low incidence of multiply innervated junctions after P12, we used antibody staining instead of lipophilic dyes to label competing axons at P16-17. Competing axons innervating the same junction at this age were traced several hundred micrometers back into nerve bundles to confirm that they were separate axons. 10. D. A.

distance from the competitor. Therefore, we presume that the strength or extent of the shortrange destabilizing signals increases during synaptic maturation [as synaptic efficacy is increasing (11)] or that the destabilization process is itself incremental (taking longer to remove distant synapses than nearby ones), or that both processes occur. Because the decreasing signals may become totally ineffective when the competitors are sufficiently separated (17), the normal confinement of all the incoming axons to a small AChR plaque may thus be a strategy that encourages strong competition among nearby synapses, which rapidly results in single innervation at developing neuromuscular junctions. Given the existence of competitive synaptic reorganization on neurons (18) and the evidence for the restriction of axonal innervation to parts of a dendritic arbor (19), it seems likely that analogous short-range signals operate throughout the nervous system.

Sternomastoid muscles were then dissected and placed in petri dishes in physiological saline. In some cases, junctional AChRs were labeled for 10 min with tetramethyl rhodamine­conjugated -bungarotoxin (5 g/ ml) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Sharp electrodes (5 to 10 megohms, as measured with 3 M KCl) were backfilled with a 1% solution of 3,3 -dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate (DiO) (Molecular Probes) in a 100% solution of methylene chloride (Sigma) and positioned on a superficial neuromuscular junction. Depolarizing current (200 ms, 1 to 10 nA, and 1 Hz) was applied for a few seconds until a dye crystal was deposited at the junction. The muscle was then fixed in a 4% solution of paraformaldehyde for 12 hours, over which time the fluorescent DiO lipid labeled many terminals of one motor unit that were distributed over several hundred micrometers. For the labeling of two competing axons at the same neuromuscular junction, two electrodes [each containing 1% solutions of either 1,1 -dioctadecyl-3,3,3 ,3 -tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) (Molecular Probes) or DiO in a 100% solution of methylene chloride] were used to deposit dye. In this way, two different subsets of axon terminals, which by chance occasionally converged at the same junction, were labeled. All labeled junctions were imaged with confocal microscopy (Noran Odyssey, Olympus Fluoview, and Bio-Rad MRC1024) with 1.4­numerical aperture objectives, and three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions were generated with the Bio-Rad MRC1024 software. 5.

The Role of Far1p in Linking the Heterotrimeric G Protein to Polarity Establishment Proteins During Yeast Mating

Anne-Christine Butty, Peter M. Pryciak, Linda S. Huang, Ira Herskowitz, Matthias Peter* Heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate (GTP)­binding proteins (G proteins) determine tissue and cell polarity in a variety of organisms. In yeast, cells orient polarized growth toward the mating partner along a pheromone gradient by a mechanism that requires Far1p and Cdc24p. Far1p bound G and interacted with polarity establishment proteins, which organize the actin cytoskeleton. Cells containing mutated Far1p unable to bind G or polarity establishment proteins were defective for orienting growth toward their mating partner. In response to pheromones, Far1p moves from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Thus, Far1p functions as an adaptor that recruits polarity establishment proteins to

the site of extracellular signaling marked by G cytoskeleton in a morphogenetic gradient.

Asymmetric cellular organization or cell polarity is a central feature of morphogenesis and is controlled by both internal and external signals (1). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mating pheromones trigger a mitogen-activated

to polarize assembly of the

protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway, culminating in arrest of the cell cycle, changes in gene expression, and altered cell polarity and morphology (2). These responses are initiated by a cell-surface receptor coupled to a G protein. Activation of the pheromone receptor triggers dissociation of the heterotrimeric G protein into subunits G and G , which in turn signal to downstream effectors to induce cellular responses (3). Cells use a pheromone gradient to locate their mating partner and polarize their actin cytoskeleton toward the site of the highest pheromone concentration (4). Far1p and Cdc24p are necessary for oriented cell polarity: specific alleles of FAR1 (far1-s) and CDC24 (cdc24-m) have been identified which cause a specific mating defect, because

these cells are unable to locate their mating partner (5, 6). Genetic experiments also implicate the G protein in the regulation of cell polarity during mating (7). Morphological changes during mating depend on reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton by a group of proteins including Cdc24p, Bem1p, Cdc42p, and the two Gic proteins (Gic1p and Gic2p) that are necessary for establishment of cell polarity (1, 8). Cdc24p functions as a GDP-GTP exchange factor (GEF) for Cdc42p (9), whereas the Gic proteins are effectors of Cdc42p involved in organizing the actin cytoskeleton (8). Bem1p contains two SH3 domains and interacts with Cdc42p, Cdc24p, Ste20p, Far1p and, Ste5p (10­13). Bem1p coimmunoprecipitates with actin (12), suggesting that it is involved in recruiting the actin cytoskeleton to the site of polarization. Little is known about how the polarity establishment proteins are targeted to the site of polarization. To examine the role of Far1p in orienting polarized growth during mating, we tested by two-hybrid analysis whether Far1p was able to interact with the polarity establishment

R E P O R T S proteins Bem1p, Cdc42p, Cdc24p, and Gic2p (14, 15). Far1p interacted with Bem1p, Cdc24p, and Cdc42p but not with Gic2p or a truncated Cdc24p, which lacks a portion of the NH2-terminal domain (Table 1). Far1p was unable to interact with the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rho1p, demonstrating that Cdc42p is a specific GTPase-binding partner of Far1p. Far1p preferentially bound to Cdc42p in its active GTP-bound state, whereas little binding was observed when Cdc42p was bound to guanosine diphosphate (GDP). Because Bem1p also interacted with Cdc42p in a GTP-dependent manner (Table 1) (10, 11), we tested whether the interaction between Far1p and Cdc42p-GTP was dependent on the presence of Bem1p. The interaction between Cdc42p and Far1p was abolished in a strain deleted for BEM1, whereas Cdc24p was able to interact with Far1p under these conditions (Table 1). Thus, Far1p interacts with the polarity establishment proteins Bem1p and Cdc24p, and Bem1p may bridge the interaction between Far1p and Cdc42pGTP.

To examine whether Bem1p could directly bind to Far1p in vitro, Far1p was fused at its NH2-terminus to two copies of the polyoma epitope (PT-Far1p) and purified from yeast (16). Cells expressing a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope­tagged version of Far1p (HAFar1p) were used as a control. PT-Far1p was immobilized on a polyoma antibody affinity column and probed with Bem1p expressed as a 6His protein in Escherichia coli. After extensive washing, Far1 protein was eluted using polyoma-peptide, and bound Bem1p was detected by immunoblotting. Bem1p readily bound to the PT-Far1p column (Fig. 1A), whereas no binding was detected with HAFar1p, demonstrating that Far1p and Bem1p interact specifically in vitro. Treating the cells expressing PT-Far1p with factor did not alter the efficiency of binding between Far1p and Bem1p, suggesting that the interaction between Far1p and Bem1p was not modified by pheromone induction (13, 15). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments also confirmed that Far1p interacted with Cdc24p in vivo: cells expressing epitope-tagged Cdc24p (HA-Cdc24p) or control cells expressing untagged Cdc24p were treated with factor, and then HA-Cdc24p was precipitated with HA11 antibodies and analyzed for the presence of Far1p expressed from the inducible GAL promoter by immunoblotting (17). Far1p readily coprecipitated with Cdc24p (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that Far1p bound to Cdc24p in vivo. To determine whether Far1p might be an effector of G , we next tested the ability of Far1p to coprecipitate with Ste4p, the subunit of the yeast heterotrimeric G protein (Fig. 1C). Far1p was readily detectable in HA11 immunoprecipitates from cells expressing epitope-tagged Ste4p (HA-Ste4p) but not in immunoprecipitates from control cells expressing untagged Ste4p. In addition, a specific interaction between Far1p and Ste4p was detected by two-hybrid analysis (Table 1 and Fig. 2A). Because expression of Ste4p activates the pheromone response pathway, these experiments do not address whether the interaction between Far1p and Ste4p is regulated by pheromones. However, G bound to Far1p and could use Far1p to orient the cytoskeleton toward the mating partner. Cdc24p interacts with Ste4p (6, 18), and mutants of Cdc24p have been identified which fail to interact with G (6). The interaction of Cdc24p and Ste4p in vivo is likely to depend on Far1p. First, the interaction between Cdc24p and Ste4p assessed by the two-hybrid system was abolished in strains deleted for FAR1 (Fig. 1D). Second, Far1p interacted independently with both Cdc24p and Ste4p (Table 1 and Fig. 2), and Cdc24 mutant proteins that were unable to interact with Ste4p (6, 18) were all unable to

bind Far1p (Table 1), indicating that the domain of Cdc24p that mediated interaction with Far1p was also required for the interaction with Ste4p. Finally, genetic analysis indicated that cdc24-m and far1-s mutants are defective in the same pathway (Fig. 1E) (19). Thus, Far1p is needed to bridge the interaction between G and the polarity establishment proteins in vivo. To address the functional importance of the interaction between Far1p, G , and the polarity establishment proteins, we tested whether any of the mutant Far1 proteins unable to orient polarization in vivo (5) failed to interact with Bem1p, Cdc42p, Cdc24p, or Ste4p (Fig. 2) (20). Far1p1­389, which lacked the COOH-terminal half of the protein, was defective for interacting with Bem1p, Cdc24p, and Cdc42p, although it was able to bind Ste4p. Similarly, the Far1p-H7 mutation (5) was unable to bind to Bem1p and Cdc42p and exhibited strongly reduced binding to Cdc24p, but still allowed efficient interaction with G (Fig. 2). Analysis of additional Far1p mutants indicated that the RING finger domain of Far1p was necessary and sufficient for interaction with G . Mutants lacking all or part of the RING finger domain were unable to form oriented mating projections, Fig. 1. Far1p interacts with the polarity establishment proteins Bem1p, Cdc42p, and Cdc24p, as well as Ste4p, the subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein.

Far1p tagged with two copies of the polyoma epitope (PT-Far1p; lanes 1 and 2) or with an HA-epitope as a control (HA-Far1p; lane 3) was purified from cells which were either treated ( ; lanes 2 and 3) or not treated (­; lane 1) with factor

Wild-type or various mutant Far1p fused to the activation domain are schematically represented on the left (20); expression of the -Gal reporter was quantified and shown as Miller units with standard deviations as described (15). Far1p1­389 correspond to Far1p-c (5, 31). Note that the binding sites for Ste4p and Cdc24p are separable.

Ste4p binds to the RING finger domain in the NH2-terminal part of Far1p (gray box), whereas Bem1p and Cdc24p require sequences in the COOH-terminal domain of Far1p. The striped box indicates a domain of Far1p that shows homology to Ste5p (28). Binding of Far1p to Cdc42p-GTP is dependent on the presence of Bem1p (Table 1).

(B) Far1p interacts with Cdc24p in vivo. HA-tagged Cdc24p (lanes 2 and 3) or untagged Cdc24p as a control (lane 1) was immunoprecipitated with HA11 antibodies from extracts prepared from far1 cells, which express Far1p from the inducible GAL promoter (17). Expression of Far1p was induced by addition of galactose ( ) or repressed by the addition of glucose (­). Immunoprecipitates were blotted with polyclonal antibodies against Far1p (upper panel) or Cdc24p (lower panel). The bracket marks the position of Far1p; the arrow points to the position of HA-Cdc24p. (C) Far1p interacts with Ste4p in vivo. Extracts prepared from cells expressing Ste4p tagged with an HA-epitope (lanes 1 and 2) or untagged Ste4p as a control (lanes 3 and 4) were incubated with antibodies to HA, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed for the presence of bound Far1p (upper panel) or Ste4p (lower panel) by immunoblotting with polyclonal antibodies. Extracts prepared from cells lacking Far1p (lane 5) or Ste4p (lane 6) confirm the specificity of the antibodies. Note that ste4 cells express low amounts of Far1p, because basal levels of Far1p depend on a functional signaling pathway (31).

Bars show mean -galactosidase activity SD for four independent transformants. Plasmids were pBTM-CDC24 (DBD-Cdc24), pGADXP (vector), pGAD-STE4 (AD-Ste4, low expression), and pGADXP-STE4 (AD-Ste4, high expression) (14). (E) Far1p and Cdc24p function in a common pathway during cellular orientation (19). far1-c or cdc24-m single mutants mate with comparable efficiency to far1-c cdc24-m double mutants, suggesting that the two mutant proteins are defective in the same cellular function. In contrast, far1-c pea2-2 cells are synthetic sterile (5).

R E P O R T S plasma membrane. G then activates the pheromone response pathway resulting in redistribution of Far1p from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic Far1p is recruited to the site of the incoming signal by binding to G , thereby targeting the polarity establishment proteins Cdc24p, Bem1p, and Cdc42p to the site of polarization. Cdc42p becomes locally activated, which triggers polymerization of the actin cytoskeleton. We propose that Far1p functions as a scaffold molecule linking G to the polarity establishment proteins Cdc24p, Bem1p, and Cdc42p. Far1p is thus analogous to Ste5p, which links G to the MAP kinase cascade by directly interacting with Fus3p, Ste7p, and Ste11p (26, 27). In addition to this functional similarity, Ste5p and Far1p share two domains with significant sequence similarity (28): an NH2terminal RING finger that is necessary for G binding (29), and a short stretch in the COOH-terminus. Although both Far1p and Ste5p interact with Bem1p, neither of the two conserved domains appears to be involved in this binding (Fig. 2). Mutations in Ste4p have been identified which function efficiently for signal transduction, but exhibit a severe mating defect presumably because they are unable to orient cell polarity toward the mating partner (30), suggesting that specific Ste4p mutations may be able to distinguish between several effectors. It is not known whether these mutant Ste4 proteins are defective for their interaction with Far1p. Far1p was originally identified because it is required to arrest the cell cycle in response to pheromones, probably by inhibiting the activity of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28p-Clnp (31). As we show, Far1p also functions as an effector of G which is involved in cytoskeletal polarization during mating. These two activities are mutationally separable (5, 32). Thus, distinct binding partners of Far1p are necessary to mediate the different functions, suggesting that multiple Far1p complexes execute these responses in vivo (5). Heterotrimeric G proteins determine cell polarity in a variety of organisms, for example, in orientation of cell division axes in early Caenorhabditis elegans embryos (32) or in response to chemotactic cytokines in

suggesting that binding of G to Far1p is

essential for the mating function of Far1p in vivo (21). Thus, Far1p contains separable binding sites for G , Cdc24p, and Bem1p (Fig. 2B), and binding of Far1p to both G and the polarity establishment proteins is likely to be required for oriented cell polarity during mating. Although pheromones did not alter the interaction between Far1p, G , and the polarity establishment proteins when assayed by coimmunoprecipitation or two-hybrid experiments, these interactions may be regulated in vivo by compartmentalization of Far1p. In the absence of pheromone, Far1p was found predominantly in the nucleus of G1 cells (Fig. 3) (22). Because Bem1p and Cdc42p are localized at the site of polarized growth during budding (23), Far1p may be unable to interact with these proteins during vegetative growth in the absence of factor. We found that a fraction of Far1p was distributed throughout the cytoplasm in cells treated with pheromones (shmoos; Fig. 3), indicating that Far1p relocalizes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to pheromones (24). Far1p did not accumulate at shmoo tips of factor-treated cells, suggesting that only a small fraction of Far1p interacts with G or that its interaction with G might be transient. Like wild-type Far1p, truncated Far11­389 protein was localized to the cytoplasm in pheromone-treated cells (Fig. 3), indicating that the COOH-terminal domain, which mediated the interaction with Bem1p, Cdc24p, and Cdc42p, was not required for the redistribution of Far1p. Relocalization of Far1p appears to require activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway triggered by factor (25). Thus, Far1p changes its localization in an factor­dependent manner, suggesting that compartmentalization prevents Far1p from interacting with G and the polarity establishment proteins in the absence of pheromones. Our results support the following model for how growth is directed toward the mating partner. In the absence of pheromones, Far1p is localized in the nucleus, and the polarity establishment proteins organize the actin cytoskeleton toward the bud site. The presence of pheromones activates the receptors, leading to dissociation of G from G at the

leukocytes (33). In Drosophila melanogaster, signaling mediated by the G protein­coupled receptor, Frizzled, polarizes precursor cells and specifies asymmetric cell divisions by properly orienting mitotic spindles (34). Although the effectors of the G proteins in these systems are not known, the domain of Cdc24p required to interact with Far1p is conserved in mammalian exchange factors such as the DBL proto-oncogene (6), suggesting that Far1p-like molecules may link G protein coupled receptor signaling pathways to polarized cell growth in all eukaryotes.

Unless noted otherwise two-hybrid assays were performed using pEG202-based plasmids expressing LexA DNA-binding domain fusions (DBD), and pJG45-based plasmids containing fusions to the B42 transcriptional activation domain (AD) (35). pEG203 and pJG4-6 are derivatives of pEG202 and pJG4-5, respectively, with an altered polylinker (kind gift of E. O'Shea). The FAR1 coding sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the primers oTP410 and oTP404, digested with Nco I and Xho I, and ligated into pJG4-6 to yield ACB412. The sequences of all primers used in this study are available as supplementary material at www.sciencemag.org/ feature/data/983067.shl. The coding sequence of wild-type CDC24 or CDC24-M alleles (6) was amplified by PCR using the primers oTP474 and oTP464, digested with Eco RI and Xho I, and ligated into pEG202. Plasmid pKP1, which allows expression of an NH2-terminally truncated Cdc24p (amino acids 283 to 853) fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain, was constructed by ligating the genomic 2300­base pair (bp) Eco RI­Bam HI fragment of CDC24 into pEG202. pBTM-CDC24 (2 m, TRP1, lexA DBD-CDC24) contains full-length, PCR-amplified CDC24 inserted into pBTM116 (36) as a Bam HI­Pst I fragment.

were washed three times with binding buffer and Far1p was then specifically eluted with binding buffer containing 10 M polyoma peptide (EYMPME) and 0.1% N-octylglucoside (Fluka). Bound Bem1p-6His was detected by immunoblotting using polyclonal antibodies against Bem1p (12). 17. YMP290 cells (MATa ade2-1 trp1-1 can1-100 leu23,112 his3-11,15 ura3 GAL psi ssd1-d2 bar1-1 far1) were transformed with a plasmid expressing epitope-tagged HA-Cdc24p or for control untagged Cdc24p from the ADH-promoter and a plasmid expressing Far1p from the inducible GAL promoter (40). Cells were grown in selective media containing raffinose (2% final concentration) to early log phase, at which time galactose (2% final concentration; indicated by " " in Fig. 1B) or for control glucose (2% final concentration; indicated by "­") was added for 5.5 hours at 30°C to regulate expression of Far1p. factor was added at 1 g/ml final concentration and incubated for 90 min. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in RIPA buffer [50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 20 mM -glycerophosphate, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4] containing the protease inhibitors PMSF, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, and lysed with glass beads using a bead beater (BioSpec). The soluble extract was then incubated for two hours at 4°C with sepharose beads coupled to HA11 monoclonal antibodies (BabCO). The beads were washed four times with RIPA buffer and twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) [137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM Na2HPO4-7H2O, 1.4 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.3)]. Bound proteins were eluted with gel-sample buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis with polyclonal antibodies against Far1p and Cdc24p. Polyclonal antibodies against Cdc24p were raised against a MalE-Cdc24 fusion protein (kindly provided by E. Bi) and affinity purified as described (39). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments with Far1p and Ste4p were carried out as above, except that YMP290 cells were transformed with plasmids expressing Far1p (ACB435) (40) and either epitope-tagged HA-Ste4p (pYEE181) (13) or untagged Ste4p (pTP288) from the inducible GAL promoter. HA11-immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with polyclonal antibodies against Far1p and Ste4p. 18. Z. S. Zhao, T. Leung, E. Manser, L. Lim, Mol. Cell Biol. 15, 5246 (1995). 19. Strains YACB175 (far1-c), YACB176 (far1-c cdc24m1) and YACB178 (far1-c cdc24-m3) are derivatives of RAY914 (6), whereas strains YMP487 (pea2-2) and YACB183 (pea2-2 far1-c) are derivatives of IH2627 (5). far1-c is a mating specific far1-s allele which expresses a truncated Far1p lacking the COOH domain (Far1p1­389). All strains were constructed by single-step gene replacement (37) using the plasmid pTP4 digested with Not I (31); successful replacement of the endogenous FAR1 locus by far1-c was confirmed by the appearance of truncated Far1-c protein by immunoblotting. Mating assays were carried out with the mating tester IH1793 as described (21). In contrast to double mutants between far1-c and proteins functioning in the default mating pathway (such as Pea2p) (5), far1-c cdc24-m double mutants mate with an efficiency comparable to each single mutant. 20. The set of Far1p-deletion constructs in the twohybrid vector pJG4-6 was constructed by PCR using pTP62 (22) as template and the primer pairs oTP418/ oTP404, oTP410/oTP411, and oTP328/oTP329, all of which contain Nco I or Not I and Xho I restriction sites, respectively. The sequences of all primers used in this study are available at www.sciencemag.org/ feature/data/983067.shl. The PCR fragments were purified, digested with Nco I or Not I and Xho I, and ligated into pJG4-6. The resulting plasmids are referred to as ACB418 (Far1p353­830), ACB413 (Far1p1­389) and ACB415 (Far1p174­285). Far1p1­389 corresponds to Far1p-c (31). The PCR fragment amplified with the primer pair oTP418/oTP404 digested with Not I and Xho I was also ligated into pEG203 to yield plasmid ACB414. Constructs lacking the RING finger domain (amino acids 203 to 284) or the Ste5p homology domain (amino acids 440 to 531) were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the ExSite kit as recommended by the manufacturer by PCR and cloned into pEG202 for the LexA DNA binding domain fusion (pLH163) or pJG4-5 for the B42 transcriptional activation domain fusion (pLH119). pGAD-STE4 (2 m, LEU2, truncated ADH1 promoter, GAL4 AD-STE4) containing full-length Ste4p in pGAD424 has been described previously [P. M. Pryciak and L. H. Hartwell, Mol. Cell Biol. 16, 2614 (1996)]. pGADXP (2 m, LEU2, full-length ADH1 promoter, GAL4 AD vector) was constructed by replacing the GAD/polylinker-containing Hind III fragment of pGAD GH (Clontech) with the analogous Hind III fragment from pGAD424 (Clontech); differences in ADH1 promoter length in pGAD424 and pGAD GH result in different expression levels of the AD-fusions. pGADXP-STE4 (2 m, LEU2, full-length ADH1 promoter, GAL4 AD-STE4) contains full-length, PCR-amplified STE4 inserted into pGADXP as an Eco RI­Bam HI fragment. The two-hybrid plasmids for Bem1p, Gic2p, Cdc42p, Rho1p, and Ste18p have been described previously (8). LexA-fusions to Cdc42p and Rho1p contain the COOH-terminal Cys-to-Ser substitutions to prevent prenylation. 15. Two-hybrid assays were performed in yeast strain EGY48 (35) or L40 (36). Strains YACB167 (far1 ::LEU2), LH64 (ste7 ::hisG), YACB39 (bem1 ::LEU2), YACB168 (ste4 ::LEU2) are deviates of EGY48 and were constructed by one-step gene replacement (37) using the plasmids pTP428, pLH126, pTP154, and pTP516, respectively (5, 21). Two-hybrid tester strains PPY758 (ste4 ), PPY762 (ste11 ), PPY746 (ste7 ), and PPY760 (far1 ), are derivatives of strain L40 in which the indicated genes were disrupted using ADE2-marked replacement constructs pSL2199, pSL2222, pSL2270, and pSL2200, respectively (27). Standard yeast growth conditions were used as described [C. Guthrie and G. R. Fink, Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology (Academic Press, San Diego, CA, 1991)]. Yeast transformations were performed by the lithium acetate method [H. Ito, Y. Fukuda, K. Murata, A. Kimura, J. Bacteriol. 153, 163 (1983)]. LacZ reporter activity was measured as described previously (8); averages and standard deviations were determined from at least three independent experiments. When possible, two-hybrid interactions were confirmed with both DNA- and activation domain fusions. In Fig. 2A, unspecific Miller units determined with cells transformed with control plasmid pRFHM1 (35) and the activation domain fusion as well as an empty plasmid (pJG4-5 or pJG4-6) and fusions to the DNA binding domain were subtracted from specific Miller units obtained with cells carrying plasmids expressing fusions to both tested proteins. The interaction between Far1p and Cdc24p was similar in strains deleted for STE4 ( YCAB168), STE11 (PPY762) or STE7 (PPY746), and thus was not dependent on Ste4p or activity of the pheromone response pathway. Similarly, deletion of FAR1 (PPY760) did not affect interactions between Ste4p and the Ste4p-targets Gpa1p, Ste18p, Ste5p NH2-terminus, and Akr1p. No significant differences in LacZ reporter activity were detected when two-hybrid assays with Far1p and Bem1p or Cdc24p were performed with cells treated or not treated with factor. 16. Purification of Far1p tagged with two copies of the polyoma tag (PT ) was performed essentially as described (38). Briefly, strain K2180 (MATa ade2-1 trp1-1 can1-100 leu2-3,112 his3-11,15 ura3 far1::hisG bar1::hisG GAL ssd1-d2) was transformed with plasmids expressing PT-Far1p (pTP523) or HAFar1p (pTP90), respectively, and grown to early log phase in selective medium containing 2% galactose. Where indicated, factor to 10­6 M was added for 2 hours. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer TNE450 [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 450 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, and 0.1% NP-40] and broken with glass beads in a Mini Beadbeater (Biospec). After two sequential centrifugations, the supernatant was incubated for 1 hour with protein G­sepharose beads (Pharmacia) covalently coupled to polyoma antibodies (39). Beads were washed three times with buffer TNE450 and twice with binding buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 85 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP-40]. The beads were then divided into aliquots and incubated for 30 min at 4°C with Bem1p-6His purified from E. coli (11). The beads (Stratagene); the introduced mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The fragments were cloned into pJG4-6 for two-hybrid analysis (generating plasmids pTP524 and ACB421) or pRD53 (generating plasmids pTP525 and pKP7) for mating assays. Genomic DNA isolated from strains IH2640 and IH2637 (5) was used to amplify the coding sequences of the far1-s alleles H7 and B4 by PCR using the primers oTP410 and oTP404. The obtained fragments were digested with Nco I and Xho I and ligated into pJG4-6 for two-hybrid analysis to generate plasmids ACB425 and ACB426. Expression of all Far1 mutants and fusion proteins was controlled by immunoblotting with Far1p-specific antibodies. 21. Mating and orientation assays were performed using the mating testers IH2625 (MAT lys1 far1-c) and IH1793 (MAT lys1) as described (38). Cells deleted for FAR1 ( YMP290) (17) were transformed with plasmids expressing mating-specific alleles either from the endogenous or the GAL promoter. All truncated FAR1 alleles shown in Fig. 2 are unable to perform the mating function of Far1p. Cells harboring FAR11­203/284­830 are able to arrest the cell cycle but mated like vector controls at 1% of the wild-type levels, demonstrating that the RING finger is required for the mating function of Far1p. The cells were unable to orient towards the mating partner, as determined by confusion assays (1.5-fold inhibition of the mating efficiency in the presence of excess amounts of factor, in contrast to 85-fold inhibition of wild-type cells) and quantitative analysis of the position of bud scars with respect to the shmoo site in zygotes (81% of the remaining zygotes have bud scars adjacent to the mating partner, in contrast to 18% in wild-type cells). Shmoo morphology was examined after addition of 10­6 M factor to 3 ml of log phase cultures at 30°C. Cells were sonicated, fixed with formaldehyde to a final concentration of 3.7%, and viewed by differential interference microscopy. Yeast actin was visualized with rhodaminephalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described previously [M. Peter, A. M. Neiman, H.-O. Park, M. van Lohuizen, I. Herskowitz, EMBO J. 15, 7046 (1996)]. 22. S. Henchoz et al., Genes Dev. 11, 3046 (1997). 23. M. Ziman et al., Mol. Biol. Cell 4, 1307 (1993); K. R. Ayscough et al., J. Cell Biol. 137, 399 (1997); J. R. Pringle et al., Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 60, 729 (1995). 24. The plasmid pTP68 expressing functional full-length Far1p­green fluorescent protein (GFP) has been described previously (22). A fragment coding for the NH2-terminal 389 amino acids of Far1p was amplified by PCR using the primers oTP330 and oTP331, digested with Xho I and Eco RI and ligated in a three-fragment ligation with the Eco RI­Bam HI fragment encoding GFP-S65T [R. Heim, A. B. Cubitt, R. Y. Tsien, Nature 373, 663 (1995)] and the vector pRD53 linearized with Xho I and Bam HI, to yield plasmid pTP76. YMP290 (MATa ade2-1 trp1-1 can1-100 leu23,112 his3-11,15 ura3 GAL psi ssd1-d2 bar1-1 far1) was transformed with plasmids pTP68 (Far1pGFP), pTP76 (Far1p1­389-GFP) or for control pRD53, and cells were grown in selective medium containing 2% galactose. Where indicated, 10­6 M factor was added for 2 hours. Immunoblots with Far1p antibody confirmed that full-length Far1p-GFP and Far1p1­389GFP expressed from the GAL promoter were present at similar levels in cells treated or not treated with factor. GFP fluorescence was visualized on a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope equipped with a Chroma GFPII filter (excitation at 470 to 440 nm wavelength) and photographed with a Photometrics CCD (chargecoupled device) camera as described [M. Jaquenoud, M.-P. Gulli, K. Peter, M. Peter, EMBO J. 17, 5360 (1998)]. Immunofluorescence experiments using Far1p fused to three copies of the myc epitope confirmed that, in the absence of pheromones, Far1p is localized in the nucleus, whereas in pheromone treated cells, Far1p is found predominantly in the cytosol. 25.

Localization of Bacterial DNA Polymerase: Evidence for a Factory Model of Replication

Katherine P. Lemon and Alan D. Grossman* Two general models have been proposed for DNA replication. In one model, DNA polymerase moves along the DNA (like a train on a track); in the other model, the polymerase is stationary (like a factory), and DNA is pulled through. To distinguish between these models, we visualized DNA polymerase of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis in living cells by the creation of a fusion protein containing the catalytic subunit (PolC) and green fluorescent protein (GFP). PolC-GFP was localized at discrete intracellular positions, predominantly at or near midcell, rather than being distributed randomly. These results suggest that the polymerase is anchored in place and thus support the model in which the DNA template moves through the polymerase.

For all organisms, the production of viable progeny depends on the faithful replication of DNA by DNA polymerase. A conceptual question about in vivo DNA replication remains unsettled. During replication, does the DNA polymerase move along the DNA template? or is the DNA polymerase in a fixed position with the DNA template moving through the replication machinery? Studies with eukaryotic cells have indicated that DNA replication proteins and newly replicated DNA are present at numerous discrete foci [so-called replication factories (1)], resulting in the hypothesis that DNA replication occurs at fixed locations. However, analysis of eukaryotic DNA polymerase is complicated because replication starts from many different origins and because it is difficult to orient the foci within the eukaryotic nucleus.

Like many bacteria, Bacillus subtilis has a single circular chromosome [ 4200 kilobase pairs (2)], and DNA replication initiates from a single origin (oriC) and proceeds bidirectionally (3). Most of the proteins present at the replication fork are conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (4). We attempted to determine whether, in a population of cells at different stages of the replication cycle, the replicative DNA polymerase of B. subtilis functions at fixed intra-

cellular positions or if it is randomly distributed along the nucleoid. We visualized DNA polymerase in living cells using a fusion protein consisting of the catalytic subunit (PolC) attached in-frame to green fluorescent protein (GFP). polC-gfp was placed in single copy in the B. subtilis chromosome under control of the endogenous polC promoter (5). PolCGFP supported DNA replication and cell growth when it was present as the only source of the catalytic subunit, and it was visible as discrete fluorescent foci, at or near midcell, in most cells during exponential growth (Fig. 1A) (6). In these cells, the DNA occupied most of the cytoplasmic space and appeared to extend to the cell boundaries (Fig. 1B). Two experimental observations indicated that the foci correspond to DNA polymerase at replication forks: (i) the presence of foci was dependent on continued DNA synthesis and (ii) the number of foci per cell increased at faster growth rates. We prevented reinitiation of DNA replication by inhibiting expression of DnaA, which binds to oriC and is required for assembly of the replication complex (3, 4). We fused dnaA to the LacIrepressible isopropyl- -D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)­inducible promoter Pspac (7) so that transcription of dnaA was IPTG-dependent. In the presence of IPTG (expression of dnaA), 5% of the cells lacked the visible
