ABSTRACT The Saccharomyces cerevisiae SIP3 gene was identified in a two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact in vivo with the SNF1 protein kinase, which is necessary for release of glucose repression. We showed that the C-terminal part of SIP3, recovered through its ability to interact with SNF1, strongly activates transcription when tethered to DNA. We have cloned and sequenced the entire SIP3 gene. The predicted 142-kD SIP3 protein contains a putative leucine zipper motif located in its C terminus. The native SIP3 protein also interacts with DNA-bound SNF1 and activates transcription of a target gene. A complete deletion of the SIP3 gene did not confer phenotypes characteristic of snfl mutants. However, in a mutant deficient for the SNF1 kinase activity due to loss of the SNF4 stimulatory function, increased dosage of SIP3 partially restored expression of the glucose-repressible SUC2 gene. Overexpression of the C terminus of SIP3 caused defects in growth and SUC2 expression which were remedied by overexpressing SNF1. Taken together, these genetic data suggest that SIP3 is functionally related to the SNF1 protein kinase pathway. INTRODUCTION The SNF1 serine-threonine protein kinase is required for the release of many genes from glucose repression, such as the SUC and GAL genes (1), and also affects other aspects of growth control in S.cerevisiae (2). Plant and mammalian homologs of the SNFJ gene have been cloned, indicating that SNFI is conserved through evolution (3 and D.Carling, personal communication). In S. cerevisiae, it has been proven that the protein kinase activity of SNF1 is essential for its function in vivo (4). SNF1 is physically associated with SNF4, a protein which is necessary for maximal kinase activity (4, 5, 6). To identify regulators and targets of SNF1 kinase activity, we used the two-hybrid system, a genetic method for detecting protein-protein interactions in vivo (6). This system is based on the reconstitution of the yeast GAIA transcriptional activator. GAL4 consists oftwo separable domains: a DNA binding domain of two hybrid proteins, one bearing GBD and the other bearing

(GBD) and an activating domain (GAD) (7, 8). The interaction

GAD, will bring together the two domains of GAL4, allowing transcriptional activation of a GALl-lacZ reporter gene. We screened plasmid libraries of yeast genomic DNA fragments fused in three different frames to GAD (9), for interaction with a GBD-SNF1 fusion (6), in the reporter strain GGY::171 carrying a GALl-lacZ gene (10). By screening 300,000 colonies, we recovered 16 plasmids representing four new genes named SIP] through SIP4 for SNF1 Interacting Protein (11). The SIPI and SIP2 proteins were found to coimmunoprecipitate with SNF1 and to be phosphorylated in vitro in immune complex assays of SNF1 kinase activity (1 1, 12). SIP] was also recovered as a multicopy suppressor of growth defects due to reduced kinase activity (11). SIP1 and SIP2 share sequence homology with GAL83, which affects glucose repression of the GAL genes and shown to interact with SNF1 in the two-hybrid system (12, 13). We report here the sequence and characterization ofSIP3. The SIP3 protein is not homologous to the other SIP proteins. It contains a leucine zipper motif and can function as a transcriptional activator. The results presented in this paper suggest that SIP3 plays a role in the SNF1 kinase pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS Yeast strains and genetic methods S.cerevisiae strains MCY829 (AMTa his3-A200 lys2-801 ura3-52), MCY2372 (MA4Ta his3-A200 leu2-3,112 ura3-52) and GGY:: 171 (Agal4 Agal80 his3 leu2 ura3::GAL1::1acZ) (10) have been used in this study. The MCY strains have the S288C genetic background. Standard methods were used for genetic analysis and transformation (14). E.coli strain XL1-Blue (15) was used as the plasmid host. Growth on different carbon sources was scored by spotting cell suspensions on solid medium containing either 2 % glucose, 2 % sucrose, 2 % raffinose, 2 % galactose or 3 % glycerol. Cells were grown anaerobically, except cells spotted on glycerol, by incubating plates in Biobag environmental Chamber type A (Becton-Dickinson). Cloning of SIP3 gene and sequencing Bacteria harboring a yeast genomic DNA library cloned in YEp24 (16) were screened by colony hybridization (17). Labeled probes were prepared by the random priming procedure (Pharmacia).


598 Nucleic Acids Research, 1994, Vol. 22, No. 4 A set of nested deletions (Phannacia), subcloned restriction fragments and specific oligonucleotide primers were used to obtain overlapping sequence information for both strands of the region from nucleotide -950 through +4201 by the dideoxychain termination method (18), using Sequenase (United State Biochemical) and either single-strand or double-strand plasmid DNA. Construction of plasmids To construct pPL7-1, we subcloned the 6.1-kb XhoI-SphI fragment of pGAD-SIP3,1o4, in vector YEp366R (19) digested with SalI and SphI. pPL12-1 contains the SphI-BamHI fragment of pXY53 in pUC19 (the SphI site is located in the YEp24 sequences, 0.6-kb 5' to the SIP3 StuI site). To construct pPL31-1, we introduced the 5-kb Banll-BamHI fragment in the XbaI-BamHI fragment ofthe pRS316 centromeric vector (20). Then, we subcloned the 5-kb KpnI-SacH fragment of the resulting plasmid in the pRS426 2,u vector digested with KpnI and SacH (21). Construction of gene fusions To construct pLexA-SIP3,107, pGBD-SIP31107 and pGADSIP3117, we used synthetic oligonucleotide primers to direct the synthesis of the C-terminal 122 codons of SIP3 by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (22) (Perkin Elmer Cetus kit), with pPL12-1 as the template. To construct pLexA-SIP3,107 and PGBDSIP31107, the primers were a 25-mer complementary to nucleotides 3310 through 3331, 5'CCCGAATTCGATAAGTT CACAATGC3' designed to create an EcoRI site (underlined) and a 23-mer complementary to nucleotides 4001 through 3982, 5 'CCCGGATCCTTCAGTAACTCGCG3' overlapping the BamHI site (underlined) located 309 bp 3' to SIP3 STOP codon. The amplified products were digested by EcoRI and BamHI, purified and ligated to the EcoRI-BamHI fragments of pEG202 (23), yielding pLexA-SIP3,107, or pMA424 (24), yielding pGBDSIP311a7. In pLexA-SIP3,117, codons 1 through 202 of LexA and 3 codons derived from the pEG202 polylinker and the PCR primer are fused in frame to codon 1107 of SIP3. In pGBDSIP311o7, codon 1 through 147 of GBD and 3 codons derived from the pMA424 polylinker and the PCR primer are fused in frame to codon 1107 of SIP3. The remainder of SIP3 ORF and the translational STOP codon are present in both fusions. To construct pGAD-SIP3 107, the primers were a 25-mer complementary to nucleotides 3310 through 3342, 5'CCCGGGATCCATAAGTTCACAATGC3' designed to create a BamHI site (underlined) and the 23-mer complementary to nucleotides 4001 through 3982. The amplified products were digested by BamHI and inserted after purification in the BamHI site of pGAD2F (9). In the resulting plasmid pPL19-5, codons 768 through 881 of GAD and 6 codons derived from the the pGAD2F linker and the PCR primer are fused to codon 1107 of SIP3. In pPL19-5, the fusion gene is transcribed from the ADHI promoter. To decrease the level of GAD-SIP311o expression, we inverted the orientation of the 1.4-kb HinDm fragment containing the gene fusion, yielding pGAD-SIP31107, in which the hybrid protein is expressed from the same unknown promoter used in the original pGAD plasmid library (9). To construct pLexA-SIP3, we used two primers to direct the synthesis of the N-terminal 409 codons of SIP3 by PCR, with pPL15-21 as the template. The primers were a 27-mer complementary to nucleotides -6 through 18, 5'CCCGAATT-

CATGTCCGTTCACGGGAGG3', with an EcoRI site (underlined) immediately 5' to the initiating ATG codon and a 22-mer complementary to nucleotides 1261 through 1240, 10 bp 3' to the XbaI site, 5'GTCGCTTCAAAAGCTATTAACC3'. The amplified products digested by EcoRI and XbaI were subcloned in pUC19, yielding pPL23-1. The 1.2-kb EcoRI-XbaI fragment of pPL23-1 and the 2.7-kb XbaI-BamHI fragment of pPL12-1 were ligated with the EcoRI-BamHI fragment of pEG202. In the resulting pLexA-SIP3, codon 1 through 202 of LexA and 2 codons derived from pEG202 polylinker and the PCR primer are fused in frame to codon 1 of SIP3. Disruption of the chromosomal SIP3 locus Plasmid pPL16-1 carrying the sip3A1::HIS3 disruption was made by replacing the XbaI-XhoI fragment of pPL12-1 (the XwoI protruding ends were filled with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I) with the 1.6-kb XbaI -SniaI fragment of pPL3-1, a pUC19 derivative which contains the HIS3 BamHI fragment (Fig. 1). The sip3A2::HIS3 complete disruption was made in several steps. First, we eliminated the BamHI site located 309 nucleotides 3' to SIP3 by subcloning the 2.7-kb XbaI-BamHI fragment of pPL12-1, where the BamHI protruding ends were filled with Klenow fragment, in the XbaI-Hincdl fragment ofpUC19. The resulting plasmid cut by KpnI and XbaI was ligated with the 4.6-kb EcoRI-XbaI fragment of pPL15-21, yielding plasmid pPL27-22, which contains the complete SIP3 open reading frame (the EcoRI and KpnI protruding ends were treated with Klenow fragment and the T4 DNA polymerase, respectively). sip3A2::HIS3 was made by replacing the BamHI-XMoI SIP3 fragment in pPL27-22 by the BamHI-XhoI HIS3 fragment of pPL3-1, creating pPL28-1 (Fig. 1). Diploid strain MCY829 x MCY2372 was transformed to histidine prototrophy by either pPL16-1 cut with StuI and EcoRI or pPL28-1 cut with SphI and PvulI. Southern blot analysis confirmed in both cases the presence of the disrupted allele at the SIP3 locus on one chromosome homolog (data not shown). Detection of protein interaction by filter assays GGY::171 transformants were patched on selective synthetic complete plates containing glucose (2%) and incubated at 30°C for 2-3 days. (B-galactosidase expression was determined qualitatively by replica-plating cells on nitrocellulose filters (Millipore, type HA 45 1M), which were incubated for 1 min in liquid nitrogen and transferred to plates containing two sheets of 3MM Whatman paper soaked with Z-buffer and chromogenic substrate X-gal (25). The plates were incubated at 30°C for 24 hours. (3-galactosidase assays Cells were prepared from exponentially growing cultures. j3galactosidase activity was assayed in cells permeabilized with sodium dodecyl sulfate and chloroform and is expressed as described by Miller (26). Invertase assays Glucose-repressed and derepressed cells were prepared from exponentially growing cultures as described previously (27). Secreted invertase activity was assayed in whole cells and is expressed as micrograms of glucose released per minute per 100 mg (dry weight) of cells.


RESULTS Isolation of SIP3 sequences by the two-hybrid system In the two-hybrid screen for SNFl interacting proteins, the SIP3 sequence was recovered once on a plasmid subsequently designated pGAD-SIP3 104 according to the SIP3 codon fused to GAD (Fig. 1). This plasmid conferred blue color to the reporter strain only in the presence of GBD-SNF1 (11). To confirm the specificity of the interaction with SNF1, we assayed 3galactosidase expression in strains containing pGAD-SIP31104 in combination with plasmids expressing different GBD fusion proteins. pGAD-SIP3l 104 in combination with a plasmid expressing GBD-SNF1 activated 3-galactosidase expression from the GALl-lacZ reporter gene (Table 1). This activation depended on the presence of the SNF1 protein fused to GBD because no activation was detected in the presence of GBD or a GBD-lamin C hybrid protein (Table 1). Therefore, SIP3 satisfies the criteria of the two-hybrid system for a new protein that potentially interacts with SNF1 in vivo. Cloning and sequencing of SIP3 To clone the entire SIP3 gene, we probed a yeast genomic library (16) with the 6.6-kb SphI insert from pGAD-SIP3 1104 and obtained plasmid pXY53 (Fig. 1). Sequence analysis indicated that the 5' end of SIP3 was missing from pXY53. Therefore, we reprobed the library with the 0.65-kb StuI-XbaI fragment from the 5' region of SIP3 in pXY53 and recovered pPL15-21, which contains the complete SIP3 gene (Fig. 1). SIP3 encodes an 1229 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of 142 kD

Nucleic Acids Research, 1994, Vol. 22, No. 4 599 (Fig.2). SIP3 is not homologous to any sequence in the GenBank database (release 79: October 15, 1993). Using the MOTIFS program (University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group), we identified near the C terminus of SIP3, beginning at residue 1156, 4 leucines spaced exactly seven residues apart that may constitute a leucine zipper (28). However, no basic DNA-binding domain or helix-loop-helix moti similar to those in the bZIP and bHLH-Zip families of proteins was identified N-terminal to this motif (29, 30). A second open reading frame located 3' to SIP3 was partially sequenced and does not correspond to any known gene. The SIP3 gene is located on chromosome XIV between met2 and rad 50, as judged by hybridization to prime lambda-clone grid filters (L.Riles, personal communication). The C-terminal region of SIP3 interacts with SNF1 Sequence analysis indicated that pGAD-SIP3 104 contains a GAD domain fused to the last 125 amino acids of SIP3. We could not exclude that other sequences, located 3' to SIP3 in pGADSIP3 104, contributed to j-galactosidase activation in the twohybrid experiments. Therefore, we constructed pGAD-SIP31107' expressing only a fusion of GAD to codon 1107 of SIP3, and pPL7-1, containing the remaining inserted sequences present in pGAD-SIP3 1104 (Fig. 1). We co-transformed GGY:: 171 with each of these two plasmids and with a plasmid expressing GBDSNF1. No 3-galactosidase activity was detected in transformants carrying pPL7- 1, indicating that the sequences 3' to SIP3 do not contribute to activation (data not shown). The C-terminal 122

amino acids of SIP3 fused to GAD were sufficient for the interaction with GBD-SNF1 (Table 1).

DNA bound LexA-SIP3,107 transcription fusion protein activates

of an activator protein to the lexA operator. We co-transformed a wild-type strain with pLexA-S1P3,107 and each of the lexAop-GALI-lacZ target plasmids. ,-galactosidase activity from the target genes containing one and six lexA operators was increased 2000- and 5000-fold, respectively, confirming that the last 122 amino acids of SIP3 are involved in transcriptional activation (Table 2). High-level activation was also observed in a snfl mutant host (data not shown). The native SIP3 protein interacts with SNF1 and activates transcription The results obtained with the C-terminal domain of SIP3 suggest that the native SIP3 protein might both interact with GBD-SNF1 and activate transcription, without requiring fusion to GAD. To test this hypothesis, we co-transformed GGY::171 with pGBDSNF1 and the multicopy plasmid pPL15-21 expressing SIP3. Activation of 3-galactosidase expression by SIP3 was detected and was dependent on the presence of GBD-SNF1 (Table 1).

To test the interaction between SNF1 and the C-terminal 122 amino acids of SIP3 in the reciprocal combination, we constructed a GBD-SIP3107 hybrid protein. Interestingly, this fusion activated GALI-lacZ transcription in the absence of GAD-SNF1, suggesting that the C-terminal region of SIP3 contains a transcriptional activation domain (Table 1). To further characterize the transcriptional activating capacity of this region of SIP3, we created the LexA-SIP31107 fusion, which contains the same SIP3 sequences as the analogous GBD fusion, and tested its ability to activate the transcription of target genes containing zero, one or six lexA operators located 5' to the promoter of the GALl-lacZ gene fusion (7). In this assay, transcription from the GAL] promoter is dependent on the binding

Proteins were expressed from pLexA-SIP31107, pLexA-SIP3 and pEG202 which expresses LexA protein (23).

Strains carrying plasmids were grown in synthetic complete medium containing 2% glucose and lacking uracil to maintain plasmid selection and derepressed for 3 hours. Other strains were grown in rich medium (YEP) containing 2% glucose. Mid-log phase cultures were derepressed by shifting to the same medium containing 0.05% glucose for 3 hours (transformants) or 2.5 hours (other strains). Wildtype segregants from the tetrads were assayed. Values represent averages of derepressed invertase activity in two to four strains. Standard error is < 15% except for snf4A2 transformants containing pPL15-21, where the standard error was 22% due to variation in plasmid copy-number. For all strains values for glucose repressed cells were c 1. This activation was due to SIP3 and not other yeast sequences present in pPL15-21, because the pPL31-1 plasmid containing only SIP3 also activated ,B-galactosidase expression (data not shown). The transformants expressing the GBD-SIP3llo7 hybrid protein gave more 3-galactosidase units than those co-expressing GBD-SNF1 and SIP3. This difference could be due to a low level of SIP3 expression from its native promoter in pPL15-21 or may suggest that SIP3 interacts weakly with SNFl. We also tested the ability of a LexA-SIP3 fusion containing the entire SIP3 sequences to activate transcription. We detected significant (-galactosidase activity from the GALl-lacZ target gene containing six lexA operators (Table 2). Immunoblot analysis using anti-LexA showed extensive degradation of the LexA-SIP3 hybrid protein (data not shown) which may account for the low level of ,B-galactosidase expression in this experiment. Nevertheless, these data confirm that LexA-SIP3 when bound to the LexA operator is capable of functioning as a transcriptional activator. The entire SIP3 protein was also fused to GBD and GAD. GBDSIP3 did not activate transcription by itself and neither GBD-SIP3 nor GAD-SIP3 interacted with GAD-SNF1 or GBD-SNF1,

respectively (data

not

shown). These negative results probably

Disruption of the SIP3 chromosomal locus To determine the phenotype caused by loss of SIP3 gene function, we replaced the wild-type sequence on one chromosome of a diploid, either by the sip3A1::HIS3 allele expressing only the first 409 amino acids of SIP3 or by the sip3A2::HIS3 allele, a complete deletion of SIP3 (see Materials and Methods and Fig. 1). Upon sporulation of the diploid strain heterozygous for sip3A2::HIS3, all six asci analysed gave rise to two His+ and two His- spores, showing that the SIP3 gene is not essential for viability. SNFJ is necessary for the expression of glucoserepressible genes in response to glucose deprivation, leading to defective growth of snfl mutants on various non-preferred carbon sources. Six tetrads were therefore tested for anaerobic growth on glucose, sucrose, raffinose or galactose or for aerobic growth on glycerol at 30°C, but no defects were observed in sip3A2::HIS3 segregants. Because snfl mutants are unable to express SUC2, a glucose-repressible gene encoding invertase, we assayed invertase activity under repressing (2% glucose) and derepressing conditions (0.05% glucose) in four sip3A2::HIS3 segregants. The mutants were indistinguishable from the wild tpe (Table 3). These data suggest either that SIP3 is not involved in glucose repression or that SIP3 function is redundant. Two diploid transformants carrying the sip3A1::HIS3 partially deleted allele were similarly characterized. Interestingly, sip3A1::HIS3 segregants formed smaller spore clones than the wild-type segregants and upon further testing exhibited slower growth on rich medium (YEP) containing glucose but not raffmose, galactose or glycerol. The doubling time of a sip3A1::HIS3 haploid strain on YEP-glucose was 2.3 times slower than wild type, but there was no difference between the two strains when they were grown on YEP -raffinose. This phenotype suggests that the expression of a truncated SIP3 protein, containing only the first 409 amino acids, is detrimental during growth on glucose. The amount of invertase produced in the sip3A1::HIS3 strain under derepressing conditions was 2.5 times lower than in the wild type (Table 3). It is not yet clear whether this decrease in invertase activity reflects the involvement of SIP3 in glucose repression or is an indirect result of the growth defect caused by sip3A1::HIS3. To examine the relationship of SIP3 with SIP1 and SIP2, which

were also identified as SNF

602 Nucleic Acids Research, 1994, Vol. 22, No. 4 hybrid screen (11, 12), we constructed double mutants carrying sip3A1::HIS3 allele and siplA3::URA3 or sip2A3::LEU2. SIP] and SIP2 null mutations do not confer any growth defect (11, 12). Nevertheless, the growth defect of the sip3A1::HIS3 mutant was exacerbated by sip1A3::URA3, but not by sip2A3::LEU2. The sip3A1::HIS3 sip1A3::URA3 double mutant formed smaller spore clones and smaller colonies on YEP-glucose. No additional defects in growth on YEP -raffmose or invertase activity were detected. These results suggest a genetic interaction between SIP] and SIP3. Increased SIP3 gene dosage elevates invertase expression in snf4 mutants The more severe growth defect observed in the double mutant sip3A1::HIS3 sip]A3::URA3 compared to the sip3A1::HIS3 single mutant suggests that SIP] and SIP3 share some related function. SIP] was also recovered as a multicopy suppressor of growth defects of a snf4A2 mutant, which is deficient in SNF1 kinase activity, and increased gene dosage of SIP] restored invertase activity in this mutant (11). Therefore, snf4D2 cells were transformed by the multicopy plasmid pPL31-1. Increased gene dosage of SIP3 did not suppress the growth defects of the snf4A2 mutant on sucrose, raffinose, galactose or glycerol. However, increased SIP3 gene dosage partially restored the expression of invertase (Table 3). The suppression of invertase defect was also evident in assays of cells grown at 27°C, a temperature at which the requirement for SNF4 function is slightly relaxed (5). Increased SIP3 gene dosage did not affect invertase expression in a wild-type strain (Table 3). Overexpression of the C-terminal domain of SIP3 causes defects that are remedied by overexpression of SNF1 In the two-hybrid experiments, we noticed that GGY:: 171 cells containing only GBD-SIP3llo7 or GAD-SIP3 107 hybrid proteins, expressed from the strong ADHI promoter, grew much more slowly than cells expressing these fusions from a weaker promoter. These findings suggested that overexpression of the last 122 amino acids of SIP3 is deleterious for the cell. The slow growth due to the overexpression of GBD-SIP3llo7 was overcome by transforming GGY::171 simultaneously with pGBD-SIP3 107 and pGAD-SNF1. These data are consistent with an interaction or a functional relation between SNF1 and SIP3 in vivo. We examined SUC2 expression in wild-type strain MCY829 transformed by pGBD-SIP31107 alone or together with a multicopy plasmid expressing SNF1. Results showed a 13-fold decrease in derepression of invertase activity when GBD-SIP3ll7 is expressed (Table 4). Co-expression of SNF1 with GBDSIP31107partially restored the invertase activity, causing a 4-fold increase. In this assay, SNF1 was expressed from its native promoter and GBD-SIP31 107 from the strong ADHI promoter, so it is likely that SNF1 is expressed at a lower level than GBDSIP31 1o7. Interestingly, increased dosage of the snfl-T2lOA allele encoding a defective SNF1 kinase (31) did not restore SUC2 expression in strains expressing GBD-SIP3 107. This is not due to a dominant negative effect of snfl-T21OA allele because SNFI-T210A mutant protein caused only a 2-fold decrease in invertase activity in GBD transformants. Immunoblot analysis previously confirmed that the SNF1-T21OA protein is expressed as the same level as SNF1 (31). These results indicate that the dominant negative effect of the C-terminal region of SIP3 on SUC2 regulation can be suppressed by overexpressing a functional

but not a deficient SNF1 protein kinase and further corroborate

that SIP3 and SNF1 are functionally related.

SIP3 is not tightly associated with the SNF1 kinase complex Immune complex assays of SNF1 protein kinase activity demonstrated in vitro phosphorylation of SNF1 and several coprecipitating proteins, including SIP1, SIP2 and GAL83 (12). To determine if SIP3 corresponds to one of the proteins that is SNF1 from both wild-type and sip3D1::HIS3 extracts by using affinity purified polyclonal SNF1 antibody and incubated the between the two extracts, suggesting that SIP3 does not correspond to one of the proteins detected in this assay (data not shown). To further characterize the interaction between SNF1 and the C-terminal 122 amino acids of SIP3 detected in the two-hybrid system, we immunoprecipitated SNF1 from a wild-type strain expressing LexA-SIP31107. Anti-LexA immunoblot analysis shows that LexA-SIP31107 hybrid protein is highly overexpressed in this strain but does not coimmunoprecipitate with SNF1 (data not shown). These results suggest that SIP3 is not tighlny associated with the SNF1 protein kinase but do not exclude

phosphorylated in the immune complex, we immunoprecipitated

immunoprecipitate with ['y-32P]ATP (4, 5). We did not

difference in the migration or the

see any

intensity of the labelled products

that SIP3 may be DISCUSSION a substrate that interacts transiently with SNF1.

We report here the cloning and characterization ofthe SIP3 gene, SNF1 protein kinase. The predicted 142-kD SIP3 protein contains at the C terminus a leucine repeat motif similar to a leucine zipper (28). Leucine zippers have been shown to promote formation of coiled coils (32) and to mediate dimer formation (33, 34, 35). Several proteins having a leucine zipper are transcriptional activators, for example GCN4, C/EBP, Jun and Fos (28). The native SIP3 protein and more specifically its C-terminal region tethered to DNA. It is possible that SIP3 activates transcription via dimerization with another protein. Several lines of genetic evidence support the view that SIP3 functions in the SNFl pathway. First, the isolation of SIP3 sequences by the two-hybrid system strongly suggests that SNF1 and SIP3 interact in vivo. In addition we showed that the native SIP3 protein interacts with DNA-bound GBD-SNF1 and activates transcription of a target gene. Second, increased SIP3 gene dosage is deficient in SNF1 kinase activity due to loss of the SNF4 stimulatory function (5). Third, the overexpression of the GBDSIP311o7 hybrid protein caused slow growth of strain GGY::171

identified in a two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with

containing the leucine zipper can activate transcription when

partially restores derepression of SUC2 in a snf4A mutant, which

on glucose and also impaired the derepression of SUC2 in the

wild-type strain MCY829. These defects

overexpression of GAD-SNF1

or

were remedied by

native SNF1 protein kinase,

respecfively. Interestingly, the invertase defect was not corrected

by increased dosage of the snfl-721OA allele, which encodes a

defective protein kinase activity (31). We can not exclude that the snfl-72lOA mutation directly affects the interaction between SNF1 protein kinase is required to suppress the negative effect of GBD-SIP31107 overexpression. Finally, the growth defect of

SNF1 and GBD-SIP31107 but it is more likely that a fully active

a sip3A1::HIS3 mutant is exacerbated by the sip]A3::URA3

allele, suggesting

a

genetic interaction. SIP1 and SIP3

are also


similar in that increased dosage of either gene suppresses the snf4A defect in SUC2 derepression. SIPI physically associates with SNFl and is phosphorylated in SNF1 immune complex assays (11). The relationship between SIP1 and SIP3 further strengthens the argument that SIP3 is functionally related to the SNFl kinase pathway. Some ofthe preceding experiments involve overexpression of SIP3 sequences, and it could be argued that SIP3, when expressed at its normal level, may not function in the SNF1 pathway. However, the final piece of evidence regarding the interaction of sipl and sip3 does not depend on overexpression of SIP3. Taken together, our evidence supports a model in which SIP3 is involved in the SNF1 pathway. The complete disruption of SIP3 confers a phenotype indistinguishable from wild type suggesting that SIP3 is functionally redundant. Southern-blot analysis at low stringency conditions detected a sequence weakly homologous to the Cterminal half of SIP3 (unpublished data). Further experiments will be required to determine whether this homology corresponds to a functionally redundant gene. What is the role of SIP3 in the SNFl pathway? In addition to its role in glucose repression, SNF1 has been shown to be involved in glycogen storage, thermotolerance, sporulation and general health (2). It is not clear yet, if SIP3 is specifically involved in one of this processes. The suppression of snf4A defect in invertase activity by increased SIP3 gene dosage suggests that SIP3 can contribute to regulation of SUC2 expression. The observed growth defect for SIP3AJ::HIS3 mutants on glucose may indicate that SIP3 is involved in other aspects of growth controlled by the SNF1 pathway.
