ines, a probable linker region between two putative globular domains (Figure 1A). The Eco1 sequence was next compared with libraries of known sequence domains and motifs. The sequence segment 33­57 has a positive score ( 0.9; but statistically not significant E value 1) with the classical C2H2 Zn finger domain model of PFAM in the global domain search mode [6, 9]. The Eco1 sequence differs from the well-known PROSITE motif PS00028 "C-x(2,4)-C-x(3)[LIVMFYWC]-x(8)-H-x(3,5)-H" by a two-residue insertion in the loop spanning the cysteine and the histidine residues in the motif center (14 residues in loop 39­42 from Eco1 instead of 12 in the classical motif). We also found that the PFAM model PF00583 "Acetyltransferase (GNAT) family" matches region 212­236 of Eco1 in the local (domain fragment) search mode (score 12.1, E 0.009). Generally, such short fragment hits do not implicate any relationship with the protein sequence family represented by the HMM model, if they are not substantiated by additional, nonstatistical arguments (for example, structural considerations or biological context) [10]. In this case, the sequence piece is essentially identical to the part of the acetyltransferase model describing the motif A, the acetyl-coenzyme A binding region of the GNAT superfamily, and critical residues for ligand binding, such as R222, G225, and D232, are well conserved [11, 12]. In addition to this functional argument, we found highly similar secondary structure predictions among Eco1 proteins (see below, Figure 1). Third, we collected the family of sequences homologous to Eco1 with Blast/Psi-Blast [13, 14] and HMM [15] searches and found representatives for a number of eukaryotes, including all heavily sequenced species among fungi, animals, and plants (Figure 1B and our website at http://mendel.imp.univie.ac.at/SEQUENCES/ ECO1/). Both in the human and the mouse EST databases, two distinct Eco1 variants with different tissuespecific expression (as deduced from EST annotations) were detected. All homologs of Eco1 in other species have also been subjected to the same three-step analysis procedure. The C2H2 Zn finger-like motif of yeast Eco1 was found in all apparently complete sequences, except for the protozoan proteins from Trypanosoma brucei (embl CAB95441) and Leishmania major (embl AL499619, conceptual translation from genomic clone). Remarkably, a Drosophila acetyltransferase MOF that belongs to a MYST family of histone acetyltransferases characterized by the presence of C2HC Zn finger close to their catalytic domain is demonstrated to use the Zn finger to contact the nucleosome and the histone H4 N-terminal tail. Mutations in the Zn finger greatly diminish MOF activity in vitro [16]. Indications for an acetyltransferase domain, previously referred to as Eco1 domain [6], were also detected in all homologs. The amino acid sequence region 945­1008 of Eco1 from Drosophila melanogaster was the best hit in a domain fragment search with the PFAM model PF00583 (score, 17.5; E value, 6.4e-05). In the

Summary Cohesion between sister chromatids is established during S phase and maintained through G2 phase until it is resolved in anaphase (for review, see [1­3]). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a complex consisting of Scc1, Smc1, Smc3, and Scc3 proteins, called "cohesin," mediates the connection between sister chromatids [4­6]. The evolutionary conserved yeast protein Eco1 is required for establishment of sister chromatid cohesion during S phase but not for its further maintenance during G2 or M phases or for loading the cohesin complex onto DNA [6, 7]. We address the molecular functions of Eco1 with sensitive sequence analytic techniques, including hidden Markov model domain fragment searches. We found a two-domain architecture with an N-terminal C2H2 Zn finger-like domain and an 150 residue C-terminal domain with an apparent acetyl coenzyme A binding motif (http://mendel.imp. univie.ac.at/SEQUENCES/ECO1/). Biochemical tests confirm that Eco1 has the acetyltransferase activity in vitro. In vitro Eco1 acetylates itself and components of the cohesin complex but not histones. Thus, the establishment of cohesion between sister chromatids appears to be regulated, directly or indirectly, by a specific acetyltransferase.

Results and Discussion Sequence Analysis of Eco1 Reveals a Two-Domain Structure The Eco1 sequence is evolutionary conserved throughout eukaryotes, and it has significant similarity to human and mouse ESTs [7]. However, no convincing suggestion of molecular function has yet been identified [7, 8]. In an attempt to extend previous results [6], the Eco1 protein sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was subjected to a three-step sequence analysis procedure with bioinformatic methods. We first studied the lexical structure of its sequence, looking for compositionally biased regions and other typically nonglobular protein segments. We identified two polar regions of low complexity: one at the N terminus (residues 1­13) rich in positive charges (6 of 13) and another between sequence positions 95­107 with many prolines and ser-

Figure 1. Eco1 Is a Member of the GCN5Related N-Acetyltransferase Superfamily (A) Domain architecture of Eco1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For details, see text. (B) Eco1 is a member of the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase superfamily. The joint multiple alignment of protein sequences of members of the GNAT acetyltransferase superfamily (structurally aligned, [12]) and selected Eco1 sequences was obtained by manual adjustments based on PF00583 domain fragment hits, secondary structure predictions, and physicochemical similarity of amino acid types. The GenBank accession numbers are AANAT_Oa, 6980559; Hat1_Sc, 4929920; Gcn5_Sc, 5822444; Pcaf_Hs, 5542194; AAC-3 _Sm, 3745773; AAC-6'_Em, 5542089; Eco1_Sc, NP_011218.1; Eco1_Sp, T39541; Eco1_Ce, AAK68308; Eco1_Dm, AAF50579.1; Eco1_At, AL021633.2; Eco1_Hs, NT_025025.5 (the latter two are conceptual translations from genomic clones). The secondary structure elements of AANAT are shown above (the numbering is derived from [12]). The framed residues correspond to the regions designated as motifs D, A, and B by [11]. Residues in the S. cerevisiae Eco1 that abolish enzymatic activity when mutated are marked by an asterisk.

case of the latter, even the complete PFAM domain model produces a hit with a positive score (but a nonsignificant E value) for a segment comprising 98 residues. We found that the N terminus of the S. pombe Eco1 homolog is extended by more than 600 amino acids and the D. melanogaster homolog by 800 amino acids. In the first case, the N-terminal extension is the known fusion with polymerase [6, 17] and contains a UMUC domain known to be involved in DNA replication and UV protection [18]; in the fly protein case, no function could be guessed for this extension, which could also represent a genome assembly artifact. Starting from the PF00583 model hits in Eco1 homologs and relying on the highly similar secondary structure predictions for the Eco1 proteins, a multiple alignment including the Eco1 sequences and acetyltransferases with a known 3D structure [12, 19, 20] was constructed and plausibly extended both in N- and C-terminal directions. The core alignment region comprises the sequence motifs D, A, and B; the strands 2 through 5; and the helices 3 and 4 of the GNAT fold (Figures 1B and 1C) [11, 12]. Apparently, Eco1 homologs lack the helix 2 of the histone acetyltransferase structure. Considering

the low level of sequence conservation with GNAT superfamily, the Eco1 C-terminal domain represents a new sequence family. To conclude, Eco1 protein sequence analysis results indicate a two-domain structure: (1) an N-terminal region with many positive charges (K/R) and a C2H2 Zn fingerlike domain (residues 33­57, C2H2), possibly with a nucleic acid or protein binding function; (2) a proline- and serine-rich low complexity region (residues 95­107, P/S), the probable interdomain linker; and (3) a C-terminal domain with suggested acetyltransferase activity (residues 111­266, ACT) (Figure 1A). Biochemical Tests In order to test whether Eco1 has an enzymatic activity in vitro, we expressed the yeast protein as a GST-fusion in E. coli. When this recombinant protein was incubated in the presence of C-acetyl coenzyme A, transfer of

label to a protein was readily detectable (Figure 2A, lanes 1­3). To confirm that this was not due to a very tight binding of Eco1 to acetyl coenzyme A, Eco1 was incubated with a cold substrate and then analyzed by Western blot with a commercial anti-acetyl-lysine anti-

Increasing amounts of and separated on SDS-PAGE. Coomassie stain (upper panel) and phosphorimager scan (lower panel) of the same gel are shown. Eco1 band on Coomassie-stained gel is indicated with an arrow and a nonspecific band with an asterisk. Although not clearly visible on the gel, the same nonspecific band is present in the wild-type preparation but is less abundant compared to the Eco1 protein. (B) Autoacetylation of Eco1 is detected by an acetyl-lysine antibody. Wild-type Eco1 protein was incubated either alone (lane 1) or in the presence of the increasing concentrations of cold acetyl coenzyme A (lanes 2 through 5). Samples were separated on SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis with an anti-acetyl-lysine antibody (Ac-K-103, NEB) was performed. The background acetylation from the bacterial expression system (see text) is probably responsible for a weak immunoreactivity with anti-acetyl-lysine antibody in the absence of acetyl conenzyme A. (C) Eco1 does not acetylate histones. Eco1 or PCAF were incubated with C-acetyl coenzyme A either alone or in the presence of all

body (NEB) (Figure 2B). This antibody recognizes an epitope comprised of an acetyl group covalently coupled to the amino group of lysine side chain. Eco1 incubated in the absence of acetyl coenzyme A in the control reaction was detected by this antibody only weakly (lane 1). However, upon the addition of the increased amounts of the substrate, the intensity of the band detected by the Western blot greatly increased (lanes 2­5). This indicated that the reaction is accompanied by a covalent transfer of the acetyl group to a lysine residue of the protein. Eco1 was further analyzed by mass spectrometry to identify the acetylated amino acid residues. Sur-

prisingly, Eco1 purified from bacteria was found to be already acetylated on at least seven lysines. This is most likely due to autoacetylation occurring inside the cell in the process of expression. Transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A to a primary amine in aqueous solution is an energetically favorable reaction resulting in detectable rates of nonenzymatic background acetylation [21]. To rule out this possibility, we decided to confirm that the observed in vitro modification of Eco1 is dependent on its intact structure. We mutated a number of amino acids conserved among Eco1 homologs from different organisms (indicated by asterisks in Figure 1B) and tested the mutant forms of enzyme for activity in vitro. The mutation leading to a temperature-sensitive allele of eco1 was identified as glycine 211 to aspartic acid substitution [6]. In our model of Eco1 fold, this position corresponds to the fourth residue in the 4 helix in the motif A, the longest and most highly conserved motif among the members of GNAT superfamily of acetyltransferases. Strand 4 and the following helix 3 form the core of the acetyl coenzyme A binding site [12]. Remarkably, a mutation in Eco1 homolog of S. pombe, Eso1, that was responsible for temperature sensitivity was an identical glycine to aspartic acid substitution at position 799 corresponding in the alignment to position 211 of Eco1 [17]. Another mutation that we used in Eco1 was a glycine to aspartic acid substitution at amino acid 225. This position corresponds to glycine 691 in a Drosophila histone acetyltransferase MOF. Substitution of this glycine by a glutamic acid resulted in the absence of MOF activity in vivo [22]. Similarly, mutation of corresponding glycine 104 in the human spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase to aspartic acid resulted in loss of activity [23]. Two more mutations that were generated were arginine 222/lysine 223 to glycine/glycine and aspartic acid 232 to glycine. In the predicted secondary structure, all mutated amino acids are located within motif A, either in the helix 3 or immediately preceding it. When the wildtype and mutant forms of Eco1 were tested for selfacetylation in an in vitro radioactive assay (Figure 2A), only a wild-type enzyme was labeled efficiently (lanes 1­3). Mutant forms of Eco1 had a greatly reduced activity (lanes 4­15) that was weakly detected after the longer exposure times. This result demonstrates that an Eco1 intact structure is required for the transfer of an acetyl group and that this is a bona fide enzymatic reaction. A majority of confirmed protein acetyltransferases are capable of modifying histone tail domains. Therefore, we tested whether Eco1 could use histones as a substrate. Bovine histone H3 alone (Figure 2C, lanes 6­8) or a mixture of all four core histones (lanes 3­5) were incubated with C-acetyl coenzyme A either alone or in the

presence of Eco1 or recombinant PCAF, a known histone acetyltransferase, expressed in bacteria that was used as a positive control. As expected, a measurable level of apparently nonenzymatic acetylation of histone H3 occurred in the absence of any added enzyme (lane 6). However, the addition of PCAF resulted in a greatly increased acetylation of its primary targets, histones H3 and H4 [24] (lanes 5 and 8), while the addition of Eco1 had no detectable effect (lanes 4 and 7). Next, we assayed whether Eco1 can modify known

Figure 3. Eco1 Acetylates Cohesin Subunits In Vitro (A) Scc1 is acetylated by Eco1 in vitro. (Left and middle panels) In vitro acetylation assay was performed with cold acetyl coenzyme A and Eco1, full-length Scc1 expressed in baculovirus, or both proteins together. Same Western blot was analyzed with anti-acetyl-lysine (left panel) or anti-His5 antibody (middle panel). (Right panel) Same assay was performed with radioactive acetyl coenzyme A. Phosphorimager scan of SDS-PAGE gel is shown. (B) Lysine 210 of Scc1 is modified by Eco1. The middle fragment of Scc1 was expressed as Gst fusion in bacteria. Either wild-type or proteins with mutated lysines were used as substrates in an in vitro acetylation assay with Gst-Eco1.

components of the cohesin complex. First, yeast Scc1 protein was expressed in baculovirus system and incubated with cold acetyl coenzyme A and Eco1 followed by a Western blot analysis with an anti-acetyl-lysine antibody. Incubation of Scc1 in the presence but not in the absence of Eco1 resulted in a detectable degree of acetylation (Figure 3A, left panel). The identity of the band was confirmed by probing the same Western blot with an anti-His5 antibody recognizing a poly-histidine tag on the recombinant Scc1 (Figure 3A, middle panel). Scc1 was also labeled in a radioactive assay, although weakly (Figure 3A, right panel). In addition, we observed Eco1-dependent acetylation of the S. pombe Scc1 homolog Rad 21 (data not shown). S. cerevisiae Scc1 contains 31 lysines. Based on the available prediction of its domain structure (our unpublished data), Scc1 can be divided into three regions. The N-terminal and the C-terminal regions are likely to fold into defined domains with globular structure, and the middle portion encompassing the separase cleavage sites presumably constitutes an unstructured linker region. To map the acetylation site, we generated three fragments of Scc1 corresponding respectively to amino acids 1­168, 169­337, and 338­566 and expressed them as GST fusions in E. coli. Only the middle portion of Scc1 was acetylated in the in vitro assay. This region contained only six lysines. They were subsequently mutated to arginines, and the resulting mutants were assayed for acetylation by Eco1 (Figure 3B). Mutating lysine 210 to arginine resulted in loss of acetylation. Mutating other lysines had no effect on the ability of the middle portion of Scc1 to be modified by Eco1 either in radioactive assay or by Western blot analysis with antiacetyl-lysine antibody. In addition, acetylation of lysine 210 was confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis (data not shown). We tested whether other subunits of the cohesin complex can be acetylated by Eco1 in vitro. Scc3 and Pds5 proteins were expressed in baculovirus and tested as substrates in the in vitro assay. All of them were acetylated (Figure 3C), with Scc3 demonstrating the highest degree of modification. The acetylation sites in Scc3 were further mapped by deletion analysis. Fragments containing amino acids 1­174, 175­350, and 961­1150 were acetylated, while the middle portion of Scc3 was not. Mass spectrometry analysis of the acetylated fragments identified the modified amino acids as lysines 13, 36, 78, 106, 224, 1071, and 1086. The analysis of the in vivo role of a new enzymatic activity is clearly not a trivial task. For example, it took 3 years to demonstrate the galactosyltransferase activity of Fringe [25­27] after its prediction based on sequence considerations. To test whether any of the proteins involved in cohesion are acetylated in vivo, we


Brief Communication 327

performed immunoprecipitation of the myc-tagged candidate proteins from yeast under denaturing conditions followed by Western blot analysis with commercially available anti-acetyl-lysine antibodies or a specific polyclonal antibody that was raised against a branched acetylated peptide corresponding to the region of Scc1 spanning lysine 210. In the case of Scc1 and Scc3, we matched the quantity of the immunoprecipitated protein to the recombinant protein used in the in vitro acetylation assay. Although acetylation of the recombinant protein was readily detected, there was no acetylation of the immunoprecipitated protein. A weak immunoreactivity that was observed with some of the proteins after long exposure times or using high antibody concentration was likely nonspecific, since there was no difference between protein precipitated from wild-type strain and eco1 mutant strain grown at restrictive temperature. In spite of our efforts, we have been unable to detect acetylation of cohesin subunits, Pds5, and two other proteins implicated in cohesion, PCNA and Ctf18, in vivo. To further test whether acetylation of Scc1 has an in vivo function, we constructed a yeast strain containing a wild-type copy of Scc1 driven by a galactose-inducible promoter and a mutant copy with lysine 210 substituted for arginine under a normal Scc1 promoter. This strain was viable when grown on medium with glucose as a single carbon source and showed no obvious growth or morphological defects (data not shown). Considering that Eco1 function is essential in S. cerevisiae, this observation implies that if Scc1 acetylation is indeed occurring in vivo it is unlikely to be the only essential Eco1 substrate. This leaves the most interesting question of what is the crucial Eco1 substrate(s) in vivo unanswered. It still remains possible that one or more of cohesin subunits are acetylated in the process of establishment of cohesion, but this modification is transient, and the acetyl moiety is removed by deacetylases present on the chromatin. Alternatively, the specificity of the available anti-acetyl-lysine antibodies may not allow detection of acetylation of these particular proteins. Radioactive in vivo labeling has been employed in the past for the detection of acetylation of more transient nature, as is the case with p53 [28]. However, it also required overexpression of the protein in cells. Attractive candidates for acetylation by Eco1 are DNA polymerases themselves, such as Trf4 and DNA polymerase . The first was demonstrated to be specifically required for the establishment and perhaps also for maintenance of cohesion [29]. The second was shown to interact genetically with Eso1 in S. pombe [17]. Other possible targets might be components of DNA replication machinery or chromatin remodeling factors.

Conclusions We report a novel acetyltransferase activity that was first predicted in silico and then confirmed biochemically in a protein with only a marginal degree of similarity to the known GNAT superfamily acetyltransferases that had escaped previous database searches. To our knowledge, this is the first successful case of nontrivial function assignment for an uncharacterized protein with a hidden Markov model domain fragment search. Eco1

acetyltransferase is active in an in vitro assay toward a variety of cohesion-related substrates. However, it has no detectable activity toward histones. While this raises the question of specificity of the modification observed in vitro, it suggests that an in vivo target of the new enzyme will most likely be a non-histone protein. The fact that the G211D mutation that causes temperature sensitivity in vivo (1) is located in the most conserved region that is characteristic for known acetyltransferases and responsible for coenzyme A binding and (2) triggers a dramatic reduction of enzymatic activity in vitro strongly suggests that Eco1 functions as an acetyltransferase in vivo as well and the disruption of this activity causes the mutant phenotype. Our data suggest that establishment of sister chromatid cohesion is regulated, directly or indirectly, by an acetyltransferase. This observation opens an exciting possibility of searching for its relevant target and is likely to lead to a discovery of a new enzymatic pathway that is essential for cellular proliferation regulation.
