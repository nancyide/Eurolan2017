Abstract The mcm19 mutation in budding yeast aects minichromosome maintenance. In this work we have shown that this mutation leads to defects in the segregation of minichromosomes and chromosomes. The mutant cells show defective kinetochore function as judged by three criteria ± relaxation of the transcriptional block normally associated with a CEN box, stable maintenance of a dicentric plasmid in mutant cells, and mild sensitivity to the antimicrotubule drug benomyl. The MCM19 gene has been cloned and found to be the same as IML3, which codes for the ORF YBR107C. Deletion of the gene was not lethal, nor did it confer any growth defects on the mutant cells. However, the mcm19 null mutation conferred growth defects in the presence of a mutation in the TUB1 gene coding for alphatubulin. Two-hybrid experiments showed an interaction between Iml3p/Mcm19p and the kinetochore protein Chl4, indicating that the Iml3/Mcm19 protein has a role in kinetochore function.

Introduction Faithful replication and segregation of chromosomes are two major events of a successful cell division cycle. If either of these two events fails to occur with high ®delity, the result may be cell cycle arrest, propagation of aneuploidy or even cell death. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model eukaryote for a study of both these processes. The centromere of a chromosome is the site where proteins assemble to form a kinetochore complex. This complex is responsible for capturing microtubules, allowing the sister chromatids to get attached to microtubules coming from opposite spindle poles. When a kinetochore fails to attach to the microtubule or forms weak interactions with it, the chromatids may fail to move to opposite poles and chromosome non-disjunction occurs, leading to the loss of the chromosome from one of the daughter cells and gain in the other. Therefore, cells which exhibit chromosome non-disjunction could carry mutations in genes which are required for the proper functioning of the kinetochores. In the budding yeast, the centromere consists of about 125 base pairs of DNA divided into three tandem boxes ± CDE I, CDE II and CDE III (reviewed in Hyman and Sorger 1995; Hoyt and Geiser 1996; Lechner and Ortiz 1996; Skibbens and Hieter 1998). CDE I consists of an 8 base-pair sequence which is conserved between dierent centromeres. Cbf1/Cpf1/Cep1 protein binds to CDE I. The 78 to 86 base-pair AT-rich sequence forms the element CDE II that lies between CDE I and CDE III. The length and the AT-richness of CDE II are important for centromere activity. Cse4p, a variant of histone H3, shows genetic interactions with CDE II and is suggested to form a specialized nucleosome at this site (Meluh et al. 1998; Ortiz et al. 1999). Another protein, Mif2p, is suggested to bind to CDE II because of its A-T hook motif, present in several proteins which bind to AT-rich DNA (Brown 1995; Meluh and Koshland 1997).

Other proteins which have been localized to the kinetochore are Slk19p (Zeng et al. 1999) and Mtw1p (Goshima and Yanagida 2000). Models for the assembly of a kinetochore have been described which are based upon the available information on genetic and physical interactions between these proteins (Meluh and Koshland 1997; Meluh et al. 1998; Ortiz et al. 1999; Pidoux and Allshire 2000). Since all the mutants that aect chromosome mcm19-1, mcm19-1 mcm21-D1 and mcm19-1 mcm22-D1. The MCM19 gene was deleted in mcm18-1, yielding mcm18-1 mcm19D1. When deletions/disruptions were constructed, the mcm mutation of the host was always covered by a wild-type copy of this gene on a plasmid. For example, when the mcm19-1 mutant was being screened for disruption of the MCM16 gene using URA3 selection, the mcm19 host mutation was covered by the wild-type MCM19 gene on a LEU2 plasmid. MCM19 was deleted in the strains YCTF30 (ctf13-30), PWY611 (ndc10-1) and AP27 (tub1-1) strains, yielding ctf13-30 mcm19-D1, ndc10-1 mcm19-D1 and tub1±1

The presence of both mutations in each double mutant strain was con®rmed by complementation analysis.

We have been studying a subset of mcm mutants To create the double mutant cep3-1 mcm19-D1, 1cAS281 (cep3-1)

which were isolated as aecting minichromosome maintenance. The minichromosome loss phenotype of this class of mutants is not dependent on the ARS cloned on the minichromosome (ARS-nonspeci®c mutants, Maine et al. 1984a). We have already shown that MCM16, CHL4/MCM17/CTF17, CTF19/MCM18, MCM21 and MCM22 are all required for kinetochorerelated segregation process of a chromosome (Kouprina was crossed with 301-2BD19 (mcm19-D1::URA3). The diploid was then sporulated. Ura+ spores which were temperature-sensitive for growth (due to cep3-1) were assumed to be double mutants. Similarly, each of the mutant strains 3dAS282 (cep3-2), YPH1172 (skp1-3) and YPH1161 (skp1-4), was crossed to 301-2BD19 to obtain cep3-2 mcm19-D1, skp1-3 mcm19-D1 and skp1-4 mcm19-D1, respectively. Plasmids were also constructed for two-hybrid studies. Each MCM ORF was isolated by PCR and fused in frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (BD) in pGBT9 and with the Gal4 activa-

In this work we show that MCM19 is the same as IML3, a gene that codes for the ORF YBR107C and is required for minichromosome maintenance (Entian et al. 1999). We have done more detailed studies to show that a mutation in IML3/MCM19 causes segregation (Roy et al. 1997), was used as the template to amplify this ORF using the ATG primer PS4 [5¢-CGCGGATCCCGATGTCTAACGAATTACGGC-3¢, which introduces a BamHI site (underlined) and contains the ®rst 19 nt of the CHL4 ORF, starting from the ATG) and the primer PS5 (5¢-CCGGCATGCCATCACATC-3¢], which is complementary to the 3¢ end, 205 nt beyond the stop codon and introduces a SphI site). The 1.6-kb ampli®ed fragment was digested with BamHI and SphI and ligated to pBR322 digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid was digested with BamHI and SalI, and the 1.7-kb fragment carrying

defects of minichromosomes and chromosomes and the CHL4 gene was ligated to pGBT9 and pGAD424, each digested

that this gene is required for kinetochore function. Materials and methods Materials All media, chemicals and enzymes etc. have been described before (Sanyal et al. 1998; Poddar et al. 1999). Strains and plasmids The strains and plasmids used are listed in Table 1. In addition to these, YCTF30 [MATa ctf13-30 ura3-52 lys2-801 ade2-101 his3D200 leu2-D1 CFIII (CEN3.L) URA3 SUP11], YPH1172 [MATa skp1-D1::TRP1 skp1-3::LEU2 ura3-52 lys2-801 ade2-101 trp1-D63 with BamHI and SalI. This procedure yielded the plasmids BDChl4 and AD-Chl4, respectively. PCR was used to amplify the coding sequence of MCM19 with pM31-2 (the 2-kb PstI-PvuII fragment containing the MCM19 gene cloned in YIplac211; see below) as the template. The primers were PS12 (5¢CGGGATCCCGATGCCTTATACTTGGAAGTTTTT-3¢, introducing a BamHI site and containing the coding sequence beginning with the ATG) and an M13/pUC reverse 16mer sequencing primer ()21). The 1.2-kb BamHI-PstI fragment of the PCR product was ligated to pGBT9 and pGAD424, each digested with BamHI and PstI. This generated BD-Mcm19 and AD-Mcm19, respectively. All other MCM genes were ampli®ed similarly, using the ATG primer with the introduced BamHI site to fuse AD and BD in frame with the ORF. For the 3¢ end of the gene, either an M13/pUC reverse or forward primer was used, depending upon the orientation of the cloned MCM ORF within the MCSs (multiple cloning sites) of the pUC19-based yeast vectors (Gietz and Sugino 1988). In all the cases, except CTF19/MCM18, the fusion proteins retained their

MCM activities. The MCM18 ORF was ampli®ed in three independent PCRs. However, none of these fragments retained its MCM activity when fused with either AD or BD. Nevertheless, the BD-Mcm18 fusion protein retained the ability to interact with ADMcm21p and activate the transcription of all the reporter genes and so was included in our studies. Cloning of MCM19 The wild-type MCM19 gene was cloned using the same strategy as described for the cloning of the other MCM genes (Roy et al. 1997; Sanyal et al. 1998; Poddar et al. 1999). The mcm19 mutant strain M31/6A, carrying the minichromosome YCp1¢, was further transformed with a genomic DNA library cloned on a LEU2/ ARS1/CEN4 vector (Gerring et al. 1990) and the transformants were selected on minimal plates selective for the maintenance of both the minichromosomes. Faster-growing colonies were expected to carry the wild-type MCM19 gene that would stabilize YCp1¢, resulting in faster growth (Roy et al. 1997). Out of 9000 transformants, three were found to carry yeast DNA clones on the LEU2 (library) vector which stabilized YCp1¢. Recovery of the LEU2 plasmids in E. coli and restriction digestion of the clones showed that all of these carried overlapping inserts. A 3-kb PstI fragment common to all was cloned into YCplac33 to obtain pM31-1. This plasmid was found to rescue the mcm19 phenotype. A partial sequence (160 bp) of the insert was used as a query sequence in a BLAST search for homology (Altschul et al. 1990) within the complete Saccharomyces genome (Saccharomyces Genome Database at Stanford University). The sequence showed 100% identity within a 2.97-kb PstI fragment retrieved from the database. A 2-kb PstI-PvuII fragment within the clone (Fig. 1) had the same restriction map as the retrieved DNA sequence. This fragment complemented the mcm19 defect. Only one complete 245-amino acid ORF, YBR107C, was found in this fragment, and was cloned into the PstI/SmaI site, generating pM31-2. pM31-2 was digested with ClaI, which cleaves within the ORF and integrated into M31/ 6A (mcm19). Southern analysis con®rmed integration at the

chromosomal site of the cloned gene (not shown). The integrant was crossed to the wild-type strain, the diploid sporulated and the mitotic stability of YCplac111 was measured in sixty randomly picked spores. All except two spores showed wild-type stability, suggesting that the cloned gene was very tightly linked to the mcm19 mutation and was very probably MCM19. This was con®rmed as described below. A deletion-disruption was made in the ORF on the plasmid by cloning a 1.4-kb URA3-carrying SalI-SmaI fragment from pUC19U (Sanyal et al. 1998) into the SalI-ClaI (end-®lled) sites of pM31-2 to obtain pM31-3. The 2.6-kb SphI-EcoRI fragment of pM31-3, carrying the deleted and disrupted YBR107C was used to transform the wild-type diploid 301-2B ´ 8534-10A and the haploid 301-2B. Southern analysis of the transformants con®rmed the presence of the deletion in both strains (not shown). The diploid was sporulated and about 50% of the randomly picked spores were found to be Ura+. Therefore, cells carrying a deletion of YBR107C are viable. The Ura+ spores displayed a minichromosome maintenance (mcm) phenotype. The haploid transformant also had an mcm phenotype. This mcm mutation, created by the deletion of the ORF YBR107C on the cloned fragment, was recessive to the wildtype and failed to complement the original mcm19-1 mutation. This result further con®rms that YBR107C is the same gene as MCM19

252 (Lundblad 1995). While this work was in progress, Entian et al. (1999) independently showed that YBR107C was required for minichromosome maintenance and called it IML3, for increased minichromosome loss. Therefore, the name IML3 has precedence over MCM19.

Assay for loss of chromosome III The loss of chromosome III was monitored in isogenic wild-type and mutant diploids, 301-2B ´ AB1380 and 301-2BD19 ´ AB1380D19, respectively, using the rationale of Gerring et al. (1990). Each of the diploids was heterozygous for the LEU2 gene. The haploid tester strain was AP13 (MATa leu2 ade2). Six to seven colonies were assayed independently for chromosome loss and recombination as described in Poddar et al. (1999).

Transcriptional read-through assays Transcriptional read-through assays were performed as described before (Poddar et al. 1999). The GAL1-10-actin-CEN6-lacZ cassette carrying the wild-type centromere was excised from pKF71 and integrated into A3 (wild-type) and PS31-5A (mcm19) strains using the HIS3 homology. Similarly, this cassette, carrying the mutant centromere, was excised from pKF72 and integrated into A3 and PS31-5A. The assays for b-galactosidase were done by the standard method.

The rate of chromosome loss is elevated in mcm19 cells To determine the eect of the mcm19 mutation on the transmission of native chromosomes, the mutant cells were studied to determine the rates of chromosome loss and genetic recombination. The rate of loss of chromosome III was measured as described under Materials and methods. The mcm19 diploid lost chromosome III at a frequency of 1.4(0.7) ´ 10±3, which was about ®fty-fold elevated over the wild-type frequency 3(2) ´ 10±5. The recombination frequencies in the mutant and wild-type diploids were not very dierent, being 5(4) ´ 10±5 and 7(1) ´ 10±5, respectively. A mutation which leads to an increase in the frequency of chromosome loss, but not that of recombination, is considered to aect chromosome segregation but not its replication (Hartwell and Smith 1985). By this criterion, the mcm19 mutation causes chromosome loss by affecting chromosome segregation.

Two hybrid studies The plasmids pGBT9 and pGAD424 with or without the MCM gene fusions were transformed into the strain PJ69-4A, which carries the reporter genes GAL1-HIS3, GAL2-ADE2 and GAL7lacZ (James et al. 1996). Interaction between two Mcm proteins, say McmX and McmY, was assumed to have occurred if the transformant carrying both BD-McmX and AD-McmY could grow on minimal plates lacking histidine or adenine and synthesized b-galactosidase at levels signi®cantly above those of control transformants. All other methods have been described previously (Sanyal et al. 1998; Poddar et al. 1999).

The mcm19 mutant causes kinetochore-related defects At least three phenotypes have been associated with mutations which aect kinetochore function. A mutant aected in kinetochore function may exhibit stable maintenance of a dicentric plasmid relative to that in the wild-type strain (Doheny et al. 1993). The rationale for this is that a kinetochore mutation may weaken kinetochore-microtubule interactions. The links between

Results The mcm19 mutation causes minichromosome segregation defect. The mcm19-1 mutation causes the loss of minichromosomes (Maine et al. 1984a). This could be either due to defective replication or to defective segregation of the minichromosome (Sinha et al. 1986). If the replicated copies of a minichromosome fail to disjoin and both the copies move into one of the two daughter cells, the average copy number of the minichromosome would increase to more than one in cells carrying the minichromosome. This phenotype is, therefore, suggestive of a defect in minichromosome segregation. The copy number of a minichromosome, YCp121, was measured

The mitotic stability of the indicated plasmids was determined in

ten or more independent transformants of each strain, grown on selective medium at 28°C. Errors are standard deviations from the mean value in each case kinetochore and microtubules may break down if a chromatid experiences opposing forces of movement during anaphase, if its two kinetochores get attached to opposite poles. This would preserve the integrity of the minichromosome DNA. The second phenotype results from the observation that centromere DNA normally serves as a block to transcription. If the kinetochore assembly is altered, the block could be relieved and more transcription may be allowed through the centromere (Doheny et al. 1993). The third phenotype exhibited by the kinetochore mutants is sensitivity towards antimicrotubule drugs like nocodazole and benomyl. Wang and Burke (1995) have shown that low levels of nocodazole impair kinetochore-microtubule interactions. Therefore, a pre-existing defect in kinetochore function is likely to render the mutant cells more sensitive to such drugs than are wild-type cells, as already shown for mcm16, mcm21, mcm22 and ctf19/mcm18 mutations (Sanyal 1998; Hyland et al. 1999; Poddar et al. 1999).

If the CEN box carries a mutation, or if the strain has a mutation that aects kinetochore assembly, this block may be relaxed, leading to higher levels of b-galactosidase activity. GAL1-10-actin-CEN6-lacZ cassettes from pKF71 (carrying a wild-type CEN box) and pKF72 (carrying a mutant CEN box) were integrated in the wild-type and mutant strains. The transformants were selected on minimal (galactose+ranose) plates lacking histidine. The enzyme levels were assayed in these transformants. The wild-type strain produced about six-fold lower levels of b-galactosidase in pKF71 transformants as com-

Discussion In this work we have characterized yet another ARSnonspeci®c mcm mutant carrying the mcm19 mutation. The mutant showed defects in plasmid and chromosome segregation, could stably maintain a dicentric plasmid, and displayed enhanced transcription through a centromeric element, benomyl sensitivity and synthetic lethality of mcm19-D1 and tub1-1 mutations. Stabilization of a dicentric plasmid, together with relaxation of the normal block to transcription through the centromere are phenotypes associated with kinetochore mutants (Doheny et al. 1993; Hyman and Sorger 1996). Several kinetochore mutants, such as ctf13, ndc10/ctf14, chl4/ mcm17/ctf17, ctf19/mcm18 and mcm21 exhibit these defects (Doheny et al. 1993; Kouprina et al. 1993; Hyland et al. 1999; Poddar et al. 1999; K. Sanyal, unpublished observations). Likewise, benomyl sensitivity is associated with several kinetochore mutants. Perhaps their kinetochores, being defective, are more sensitive to perturbations of kinetochore-microtubule interactions caused by these drugs (Wang and Burke 1995). We have observed that several mutants in which kinetochorerelated functions are aected, such as mcm16, mcm21 and mcm22, show synthetic lethality with tub1-1 at 18°C (K. Sanyal, A. Poddar and P. Sinha, unpublished observations). This is not unexpected. A defect in microtubule structure, coupled with lesions in the kinetochore (as suggested by the relaxation of the centromeric transcriptional block), may indeed result in growth defects. We have also seen that the microtubule structure does not dier in the double mutants from that in the tub1-1 strain (A. Poddar, K. Sanyal and S.K. Ghosh, unpublished observations). This suggests that the defect in mcm19 is not microtubule related. Attempts were made to localize the Mcm19p or Mcm19p-Myc in yeast by indirect immuno¯uorescence, using antibodies against Mcm19 synthesized in, and puri®ed from E. coli, or monoclonal antibodies against a c-Myc tag. We could

Fig. 6 Mcm19 and Chl4 interact with each other. Left panel Plasmids expressing the fusion proteins AD-Chl4 and BD-Mcm19 were introduced into PJ69-4A. The transformants carrying both these plasmids could grow on minimal media lacking histidine (top row) and adenine (lower row). The growth of two such transformants is shown. The control vectors did not allow any growth. Right panel Similar results were obtained when Mcm19 was fused to the activation domain and Chl4 to the binding domain not localize this protein when it was expressed from the MCM19 promoter in single- or high-copy-number vectors in yeast cells (S.K. Ghosh, unpublished observations). We have now used the strong promoter PYK1 In summary, all these observations strongly imply a role for Iml3/Mcm19 protein in kinetochore function. We are carrying out further experiments to test if Mcm19p is centromere associated and to study the physical interactions of this protein with other proteins required for kinetochore function. Further work in this direction should help in determining the role that this protein plays in kinetochore function. Acknowledgments This work was supported by a CSIR grant (37(0944)/97/EMR-I) to PS.
