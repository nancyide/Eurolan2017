Deshaies*§ *Division of Biology and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California 91125, USA Protein and Peptide Group, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Meyerhofstrasse 1, 69012 Heidelberg, Germany e-mail: shevchenko@embl-heidelberg.de §e-mail: deshaies@its.caltech.edu SCF ubiquitin ligases are composed of Skp1, Cdc53, Hrt1 and one member of a large family of substrate receptors known as F-box proteins (FBPs). Here we report the identification, using sequential rounds of epitope tagging, affinity purification and mass spectrometry, of 16 Skp1 and Cdc53-associated proteins in budding yeast, including all components of SCF, 9 FBPs, Yjr033 (Rav1) and Ydr202 (Rav2). Rav1, Rav2 and Skp1 form a complex that we have named `regulator of the (H+)-ATPase of the vacuolar and endosomal membranes' (RAVE), which associates with the V1 domain of the vacuolar membrane (H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase). V-ATPases are conserved throughout eukaryotes, and have been implicated in tumour metastasis and multidrug resistance, and here we show that RAVE promotes glucose-triggered assembly of the V-ATPase holoenzyme. Previous systematic genome-wide two-hybrid screens yielded 17 proteins that interact with Skp1 and Cdc53, only 3 of which overlap with those reported here. Thus, our results provide a distinct view of the interactions that link proteins into a comprehensive cellular network.

S CF ubiquitin ligases regulate a wide range of cellular processes, including immunity, signalling, cell division and transcription1. SCF contains four subunits -- Skp1, Cdc53 (also known as cullin 1 or Cul1), an F-box protein, and the newly discovered RING-H2 protein Hrt1 (also known as Roc1 or Rbx1; refs 2­5). A remarkable property of SCF ubiquitin ligases is that their specificity can be programmed through an array of distinct substrate receptors6,7. These receptors are recruited to SCF by the conserved F-box

Ylr352 was identified as a Cdc53 interactor by affinity purification and protein sequencing, and as a Skp1 interactor by genome-wide two-hybrid analysis. Yj1149, Yjl204 and Yol133 baits were used in genome-wide two-hybrid screens, but no specific interacting proteins were consistently identified. **EF-2 binds strongly to the abundant F-box protein Ylr097 (A.

domain, and are tethered to the Cdc53/Hrt1 ubiquitin-ligase module by Skp1. The genome of budding yeast encodes 16 proteins that contain an obvious F-box motif7, and at least 3 of these proteins assemble into SCF complexes in vivo8. Despite rapid advances in our understanding of the structure and activity of SCF, very little is known about how this family of ubiquitin ligases is integrated into cell physiology in a global sense. A common strategy for deducing the physiological transactions of proteins is to look for interacting partners. Considerable effort has already been invested in sequential or massively parallel genome-wide two-hybrid screens for interacting proteins9,10. However, in two-hybrid screens, interacting proteins are detected in a pair-wise manner, which is a significant limitation, as many of the proteins that are involved in cell duplication are assembled into multisubunit complexes (such as SCF, the origin-recognition complex and the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). Protein­protein interactions within or between protein complexes may not be detected in two-hybrid screens if either the bait or the prey fails to assemble properly with other subunits of the complex. As an alternative method to map out a network of protein interactions, we used affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry. In this approach, candidate genes are tagged with a sequence encoding an epitope that is recognized by monoclonal antibodies, and the epitope-tagged protein, together with any associated polypeptides, is recovered by immunoprecipitation from a whole-cell lysate. Proteins that interact with the tagged subunit are separated by gel electrophoresis and then identified by mass spectrometry. New proteins identified in this manner are then tagged, and the entire process is repeated. By sequential rounds of epitope tagging, affinity purification and mass spectrometry (the entire process being termed SEAM), a network of interacting proteins can be revealed. In contrast to two-hybrid methods, this approach can identify entire protein complexes, as well as interactions between distinct complexes, in a single step. Here we report the use of SEAM to identify a new Skp1-containing complex, RAVE, which associates with the V1 domain of the V-ATPase. V-ATPase is an ATP-dependent proton pump that functions in both intracellular membranes and, in certain cell types, the plasma membrane11. V-ATPase within intracellular compartments functions in processes such as receptor-mediated endocytosis, intracellular targeting of lysosomal enzymes, protein processing and degradation, viral entry, and coupled transport of small molecules, such as neurotransmitters11. On the other hand, V-ATPase within the plasma membrane is involved in bone resorption, renal acidification, pH homeostasis and K+ secretion11. The V-ATPase holoenzyme is composed of two distinct protein complexes, V0 and V1. The V0 complex, which is embedded in the vacuolar membrane, contains five subunits and forms a proton channel, whereas the V1 complex, which docks to the cytosolic surface of the V0 complex, comprises eight subunits and contains the active sites for ATP

Extracts (6 mg) from untagged control, RAV1­Myc9, RAV2­Myc9, RAV1­Myc9 rav2 and RAV2­Myc9 rav1 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody (9E10) in the presence of 0.5% Triton X100, separated by SDS­PAGE, and stained with silver. b, Isolation of Rav1-associated proteins. Extracts (35 mg) of wild-type and RAV1­Myc9 cells were processed as described in Fig. 1a, except that the immunoprecipitation buffer contained 0.2% Triton X-100, and 9E10 beads were eluted with tobacco etch virus protease. Rav2, Skp1 and subunits of V-ATPase (Vma1, Vma2 and Vma4) were identified as Rav1interacting proteins by mass spectrometry. c, V-ATPase subunits interact specifically with Rav1 and Rav2.

hydrolysis11,12. After the V0­V1 ATPase is assembled, its activity can be regulated post-translationally; for example, in cells deprived of glucose, V1 abruptly and reversibly detaches from V0 (ref.13). Proper regulation of V0­V1 activity is likely to be crucial for cell physiology, as the proton gradient across the vacuolar membrane drives the uptake of a variety of metabolites into the vacuole. This idea is supported by the fact that thermal inactivation of the Vma4 subunit of budding yeast V-ATPase evokes transient defects in actin polarization, bud morphogenesis and cytokinesis14. Despite the importance of V-ATPase activity for cellular homeostasis, the molecular mechanisms by which this enzyme is regulated have remained elusive.

Results Identification of proteins associated with Cdc53 and Skp1. To gain insight into how the potentially diverse array of SCF complexes and their component subunits are integrated into the regulatory fabric of the cell, we sought to identify proteins that associate with SCF subunits in vivo. We constructed versions of Cdc53 and Skp1 each

fused to nine copies of the Myc epitope at their C termini (Cdc53­Myc9 and Skp1­Myc9) using a tagging method based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)5. Affinity purification using an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) showed that many specifically co-precipitating polypeptides were recovered from tagged strains (Fig. 1a). Identification of these bands by mass spectrometry revealed the presence of 15 different proteins -- Cdc53, Skp1, Hrt1, 7 FBPs (including previously unrecognized FBPs Ybr280 and Ymr258), a subunit of the Skp1-containing CBF3 complex, and the uncharacterized proteins Yjr033 and Ydr202 (Table 1). On the basis of the results presented below, we have renamed Yjr033 and Ydr202 as Rav1 and Rav2, respectively. To investigate the physiological functions of these proteins, we first disrupted the corresponding genes. This analysis revealed that hrt1 strains were inviable5, whereas rav1, yjl204 (since renamed rcy1; ref. 15) and ybr280 strains grew more slowly than the wild type, and rav2 cells exhibited no obvious phenotype. To confirm that the proteins encoded by these genes interact with Skp1, and to test for their potential incorporation into SCF complexes, we modified the corresponding chromosomal loci to encode proteins that were tagged with the Myc9 epitope. We immunoprecipitated extracts from RCY1­Myc9, YBR280­Myc9, RAV1­Myc9 and RAV2­Myc9 cells with anti-Myc beads, and immunoblotted them with antibodies against Cdc53 and Skp1. Whereas Skp1 co-immunoprecipitated with all four proteins, only Ybr280 associated with Cdc53 (Fig. 1b). These results indicate that the previously unrecognized F-box motif in Ybr280 may recruit this protein into an SCF complex. The absence of Cdc53 from Rcy1­Skp1 complexes is inconsistent with the idea that Skp1 is sufficient to link FBPs to cullins, and implies that FBPs contribute to the assembly of Cdc53 into SCF complexes.

Figure 4 RAVE mutants exhibit V-ATPase deficiency. a, Tenfold serial dilutions of cells of the indicated strains grown on YP­dextrose (pH 5.5) were spotted onto YP­dextrose (pH 5.5 or 7.5) or YP­glycerol (pH 5.5) plates and grown for 3 days at the indicated temperature. b, c, Vacuolar labelling with quinacrine. Vacuolar acidification was monitored by accumulation of the fluorescent dye quinacrine within the vacuole. Cells grown on YP­dextrose (pH 5.5) at 33 °C (or pre-incubated at 37 °C for 1 h; see insets b) were transferred to uptake buffer (YP­dextrose, pH 7.5) and stained with 200 µM quinacrine. Dye uptake was monitored by microscopic examination of single cells (b) and by spectrofluorometric analysis of populations of cells (c; see Methods). Data in c are means ± s.d. (n = 3).

Rav1, Rav2 and Skp1 form RAVE, which binds to V-ATPase. Genome-wide systematic gene deletion16, messenger RNA expression profiling17, and two-hybrid18 and bioinformatic19 analyses have all failed to identify a clear function of Rav1 or Rav2. Therefore, to investigate the cellular functions of these proteins, we modified chromosomal RAV1 and RAV2 to encode Myc9-tagged proteins, and then isolated the interacting partners by immunoaffinity chromatography and identified them by mass spectrometry as described above. Examination of proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with Rav1­Myc9 under stringent washing conditions (0.5% Triton X-100) revealed the presence of Rav2 and Skp1 (Fig. 2a), indicating that these three polypeptides may form a new protein

articles complex. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments using mutant strains, Rav1 (but not Rav2) bound directly to Skp1 (Fig. 2a), despite possessing neither an F-box motif nor homology to the amino-terminal Skp1-binding domain of Cul1. We propose that Skp1­Rav1­Rav2, like CBF3 (ref. 20) and Rcy1­Skp1 (ref. 21) form a new Skp1-containing complex that does not function as an ubiquitin ligase. To identify more loosely bound targets or regulators of the Skp1­Rav1­Rav2 complex, we repeated the affinity purification of Rav1­Myc9 under low-stringency conditions (0.2% Triton X-100). Analysis of the resulting immunoprecipitate by mass spectrometry (Fig. 2b) revealed the presence of Skp1, Rav1, and Rav2, as well as three subunits of the V-ATPase (Vma1,Vma2 and Vma4). To reflect the functional relationship between Skp1­Rav1­Rav2 and VATPase (see below), we have named the complex `regulator of the (H+)-ATPase of the vacuolar and endosomal membranes (RAVE). Topology of the RAVE complex. Immunoblotting experiments confirmed that Vma1, Vma2, Vma4 and also Vma8 were specifically associated with both Rav1­Myc9 and Rav2­Myc9 (Fig. 2c). To investigate the topology of the interaction between RAVE and the V1 subunit of V-ATPase, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments using rav1 and rav2 strains. Whereas RAVE subunits co-immunoprecipitated varying amounts of V1 from wildtype cells, Skp1­Myc9 failed to associate with V1 in rav1 cells (Fig. 3a). In addition, Skp1, Vma1 and Vma4 were absent and only small amounts of Vma2 and Vma8 were recovered in anti-Myc immunoprecipitates prepared using RAV2­Myc9 rav1 cells. Control immunoblots confirmed that levels of Vma subunits were unaffected in rav1 and rav2 cells (Fig. 3b). Together, these results indicate that Rav1 may bind directly to V1, and may in turn link this subunit to both Skp1 and Rav2 (Fig. 3c). RAVE mutants exhibit V-ATPase deficiency. To evaluate a possible function of RAVE in V-ATPase function, we investigated the growth phenotypes of rav1, rav2, rav1 rav2, skp1-12, cdc53-1 and cdc34-2 cells under various conditions. All mutants had growth rates that were roughly similar to that of the wild type on YP­dextrose (pH 5.5; see methods) at 33 °C and 37 °C (Fig. 4a; we did not evaluate skp1-12, cdc53-1 and cdc34-2 strains at 37 °C because these mutants are temperature-sensitive for growth). Consistent with a previous report22, cells lacking the Vma4 subunit of V1 were unable to grow on YP­dextrose (pH 7.5) or YP­glycerol (pH 5.5), at either 33 °C or 37 °C. At 33 °C, rav1 and skp1-12 cells exhibited a substantial reduction in growth on YP­dextrose (pH 7.5) and YP­glycerol (pH 5.5), and rav1 cells were unable to grow on these media at 37 °C. Although rav2 cells exhibited similar defects to rav1 and skp1-12 mutants, their phenotypes were milder and were strikingly evident only at 37 °C. On the other hand, the growth phenotypes of the SCF-pathway mutants cdc53-1 and cdc34-2 were similar to the wild type at 33 °C on all media. We explored further the functional relationship between RAVE and V-ATPase by monitoring V-ATPase-dependent vacuolar acidification in wild-type and mutant cells. We collected cells grown on YP­dextrose (pH 5.5) at 33 °C, washed them with YP­dextrose (pH 7.5), and incubated them with quinacrine, a weakly basic dye that accumulates in low-pH compartments23. Mutant vma4 cells failed to accumulate quinacrine, and rav1, rav2, rav1 rav2 and skp1-12 cells exhibited a reduction in dye uptake (Fig. 4b, c) that paralleled the effect of these mutations on cell growth in buffered medium (Fig. 4a). The diminution of dye uptake observed at 33 °C was exacerbated further at higher temperatures -- at 37 °C on YP­dextrose (pH 7.5), the quinacrine-uptake defects of rav1, rav2 and skp1-12 strains were as severe as that exhibited by vma4 cells (Fig. 4b, see insets). In contrast, cdc53-1 and cdc34-2 cells showed the same extent of dye uptake as the wild type at both 33 °C and 37 °C. Together, these results indicate that RAVE (but not SCF) may positively regulate V-ATPase activity in vivo. Cytoplasmic RAVE promotes glucose-regulated assembly of V1 with V0 to form V-ATPase holoenzyme. What is the mechanism of

Localizations of Vma2­GFP and Rav1­GFP in live cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy. Both constructs were integrated at their respective chromosomal loci and were expressed from their natural promoters. Vph1, a subunit of V0, was immunolocalized by indirect immunofluorescence (see Methods). Merged images in c are overlays of Nomarski and GFP images. DNA was visualized by staining with DAPI. f, Kinetics of assembly of V-ATPase in wild-type and rav1 cells. Wild-type and rav1 cells expressing Vma2­GFP were grown at 25 °C on YP­dextrose (pH 5.5) and then shifted to YP (pH 5.5) media. After glucose depletion for 10 min, cells were supplemented with 2% glucose to initiate V-ATPase reassembly and then re-incubated at 25 °C for the indicated times. Cells were then fixed and examined by confocal microscopy (upper panel). Relative V0­V1 assembly (expressed as vacuolar membrane staining intensity divided by cytoplasmic staining intensity for Vma2­GFP) was quantified (lower panel) by evaluation of the digital files using NIH image software. The amount of assembled V-ATPase in wild-type cells in the presence of glucose is designated as 100%.

action of the RAVE complex? Because rav1 and rav2 cells contained Vma subunits (Fig. 3b), but nevertheless exhibited a defect in V-ATPase-dependent vacuolar acidification, we hypothesized that RAVE promotes accumulation of the intact V1 domain, assembly/transport of the intact V0 domain, or formation of V0­V1 holoenzyme. To distinguish between these possibilities, we investigated V1 and V0 formation in rav1 cells using non-denaturing gel electrophoresis and immunofluorescence microscopy, respectively. V1 domains were absent in vma4 cells (Fig. 5a) but accumulated normally in rav1 cells at permissive temperature (data not shown) or upon shift to conditions that did not allow growth (1 h in YP­dextrose (pH 7.5) at 33 °C; Fig. 4a), which is inconsistent with the idea that RAVE functions in formation or maintenance of intact V1 complexes. Likewise, the V0 subunit Vph1 was properly localized to the vacuolar membrane in rav1 cells at 37 °C (Fig. 5d). Vacuolar delivery of Vph1 serves as a surrogate marker for proper V0 assembly11,24. Next, to determine the effects of RAVE on assembly of V0­V1 holoenzyme, we isolated a crude membrane fraction containing vacuolar membranes, from wild-type, vma4 and rav1 cells that were shifted to nonpermissive conditions (Fig. 5b). Immunoblotting revealed that membranes from wild-type cells contained high levels of Vma1, 2, 4 and 8. In contrast, Vma subunits were not detected in membranes from vma4 cells, and were present at greatly reduced levels in rav1 preparations. The Vph1 subunit of V0 was present in equivalent amounts in all preparations, showing that the experiment was properly controlled. Similar results were obtained using cells grown under `permissive' conditions (25 °C; data not shown). These observations thus implicate RAVE in docking of V1 with membrane-embedded V0. To investigate the function of RAVE in stable accumulation of V0­V1 holoenzyme in vivo, we constructed wild-type and rav1 strains that expressed green fluorescent protein fused to Vma2 (Vma2­GFP). We evaluated cells shifted to nonpermissive conditions as described above for Vma2­GFP fluorescence. The V1 complex decorated the vacuolar membrane in wild-type cells, but was delocalized throughout the cytoplasm in rav1 cells (Fig. 5c). Our analysis so far was consistent with the idea that RAVE serves either to stabilize assembled V0­V1 complexes or as an assembly

factor to promote binding of V1 to V0. To dissect further the mechanism of action of RAVE, we carried out an in vivo pulse­chase assembly experiment. Intact V0­V1 holoenzyme is rapidly disassembled in cells that are deprived of glucose13. We therefore cultured wild-type and rav1 cells expressing Vma2­GFP at 25 °C, shifted them to glucose-depleted medium for 10 min to promote detachment of V1 from V0, and then re-supplemented them with glucose. Glucose signalling promoted recruitment of V1 to the vacuolar membrane within 10 min in wild-type cells (Fig. 5f). In contrast, reassembly of V-ATPase in rav1 cells proceeded much more slowly, but eventually recovered to the original state. Steady-state assembly of V0­V1 in rav1 cells was ~50% less than in wild-type cells under permissive conditions. Thus, in rav1 cells, formation of holoenzyme proceeded slowly at 25 °C (Fig. 5f), and was essentially blocked at high temperature (Fig. 5c). The hypothesis that RAVE acts transiently to catalyse assembly of cytoplasmic V1 with membrane-embedded V0 is supported by the observations that RAVE was associated with V1 domains but not with intact V1­V0 holoenzyme upon conventional purification (P. Kane, personal communication), and that Rav1­GFP localized throughout the cytoplasmic compartment but did not label the vacuolar membrane (Fig. 5e).

Discussion We have used iterative rounds of affinity purification and mass spectrometry to decipher a network of interacting proteins anchored by the core SCF subunit Skp1 (Fig. 6). Our approach identified sixteen SCF-associated polypeptides, which comprise at least seven distinct Skp1-containing complexes, including three (RAVE, Cep3­Skp1 (ref. 20) and Rcy1­Skp1) that lack Cdc53 and are likely to have functions other than ubiquitination, two SCF complexes (containing FBPs Ybr280 and Grr1), and two uncharacterized complexes (containing FBPs Yjl149 and Yml088). We have therefore shown that Skp1 forms multiple complexes (with and without FBPs) with diverse biochemical activities, and have thus provided new insight into the biological functions of Skp1 at the junction of several intracellular regulatory pathways. Because of its generic and rapid nature, our approach provides an alternative to sequential two-hybrid screening10 as a tool for

articles proteome exploration. Combining rapid epitope-tagging and twostep affinity purification25 with automated single-step analysis of unfractionated immunoprecipitates by mass spectrometry26,27 may provide a useful complement to genome-wide two-hybrid screens18 as a means by which to deduce the entire set of protein complexes in a eukaryotic cell. Interestingly, comparison of Skp1- and Cdc53interacting proteins identified by systematic two-hybrid screens18 with those identified using the approach described here reveals that although each method uncovered ~15 interacting proteins, there is surprisingly little overlap between the two sets (Table 1). This underlines the fact that it is essential to use multiple methods to deduce the structure of eukaryotic proteomes. We have established that Skp1, Rav1 and Rav2 associate to form RAVE, which promotes V-ATPase activity by stimulating assembly of V1­V0. Although V-ATPase-deficient cells grow normally on buffered medium, rapid thermal inactivation of V-ATPase elicits a range of cellular defects, including formation of abnormal buds and delocalization of both actin and chitin14. Moreover, V-ATPase is rapidly and reversibly inactivated by dissociation of V1 from V0 upon glucose deprivation, indicating that dynamic control of VATPase assembly may be intimately linked to cell physiology13. Glucose seems to govern V-ATPase assembly by a regulatory pathway that remains to be identified13. Because RAVE is required for rapid reassembly of V-ATPase upon addition of glucose to starved cells (Fig. 5f), it is possible that modulation of the activity of RAVE (or of a protein that is recruited to V1 by RAVE) by a glycolytic metabolite links extracellular glucose concentration to the assembly state of V-ATPase. RAVE clearly increases the rate at which V-ATPase holoenzyme complexes accumulate upon addition of glucose to starved cells (Fig. 5f). However, RAVE also seems to stabilize assembled VATPase. The steady-state level of Vma2­GFP bound to vacuolar membranes in rav1 cells at 25 °C is 50% of that observed for wildtype cells (Fig. 5f). In contrast, co-immunoprecipitation and membrane-sedimentation experiments have shown that little or no intact V-ATPase complex is preserved in extracts of rav1 cells grown under the same conditions (Fig. 5b and data not shown). We speculate that RAVE promotes formation of stable V-ATPase by influencing the subunit composition or post-translational modification state of V1. In the absence of RAVE, V1 can bind to V0 (albeit more slowly than when RAVE is present), but the assembled complex is less stable to perturbation, including in vitro manipulation. Further work will shed light on the detailed biochemical mechanism by which RAVE promotes V-ATPase assembly in resting cells and in cells that have been re-fed with glucose. Methods

Yeast strains and growth media. Tagged yeast strains were constructed as described5. SKP1 and CDC53 were modified with the tagging cassette pJS-M53H (ref. 5), whereas RAV1, RAV2, RCY1 and YBR280 were modified with a variant, pJS-TM53H (RDB1344), encoding nine copies of the Myc epitope preceded by the recognition site (ENLYFQG) for the tobacco etch virus (TEV)28 protease. VMA2 and RAV1 were modified with pGFP53H (RDB1096), which encodes GFP. All knockout strains were created by oligonucleotide-mediated gene disruption29, and were validated by PCR. Oligonucleotide sequences are available upon request. The following yeast strains were used: CDC53­Myc9 (RDY1250), SKP1­Myc9 (RDY1251), RCY1­Myc9 (RDY1510), YBR280­Myc9 (RDY1511), RAV1­Myc9 (RDY1512), RAV2­Myc9 (RDY1513), rav1 (RDY1645), rav2 (RDY1646), RAV1­Myc9 rav2 (RDY1514), RAV2­Myc9rav1 (RDY1515), rav1 rav2 (RDY1516), SKP1­Myc9 rav1 (RDY1517), SKP1­Myc9 rav2 (RDY1518), VMA2­GFP (RDY1519), VMA2­GFP rav1 (RDY1520), RAV1­GFP (RDY1647), cdc53-1 (RDY690), cdc34-2 (RDY670) and skp1-12 (RDY1377). For the experiments shown in Figs 1­3, unbuffered YP medium (pH ~6.5) was used. For the experiments shown in Figs 4, 5, YP medium was buffered to pH 5.5 with 50 mM MOPS plus 50 mM MES, or to pH 7.5 with 100 mM HEPES, as indicated. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. Epitope tagging of genes, preparation of cell extracts and immunoaffinity chromatography were carried out as described5, except that immunoprecipitations and washes were carried out at pH 7.5 with 35 mg extract and 120 µl 9E10 beads. For the experiment shown in Fig. 2b, proteins were eluted with 0.1 mg ml­1 TEV protease (GibcoBRL) at room temperature for 40 min. Eluted proteins were separated by one-dimensional SDS­PAGE, visualized by staining with silver, in-gel digested with trypsin and identified by mass spectrometry as described30,31.

Active staining of vacuole with quinacrine. Vacuolar acidification was measured by accumulation of fluorescent quinacrine32. Cells were grown in YP­dextrose (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone; ph 5.5) to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.8­1.0, and 1 ml of the sample was collected and washed three times with uptake buffer (YP­dextrose, pH 7.5). The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 µl uptake buffer and quinacrine was added to a final concentration of 200 µM. Cells were then incubated for 10 min at 30 °C and were then kept on ice for 5 min, after which they were washed three times with ice-cold wash buffer (100 mM HEPES pH 7.5, and 2% glucose). Cell pellets were resuspended in 30 µl wash buffer and photographed within 1 h after quinacrine staining. To quantify quinacrine uptake, a culture grown in YP­dextrose (pH 5.5) was split into two, and the quinacrine fluorescence in 1 ml of cell suspension processed as described above was measured directly using a spectrofluorometer. The remainder of the cells were collected and weighed, and relative fluorescence was determined as total fluorescence per g of cells. Membrane fractionation and native gel electrophoresis. Wild-type and mutant cells were grown in YP­dextrose (pH 5.5) to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.8­1.0 at 25 °C, or were transferred to YP­dextrose (pH 7.5) and further incubated at 33 °C for 1 h. Cells were then pelleted, washed once, resuspended in 1 ml of synthetic medium (buffered to pH 7.5 with 100 mM HEPES) containing 2% glucose and 1 M sorbitol, and spheroplasted by treatment with zymolase (0.1 units of zymolase per 107 cells for 40 min at 30 °C with gentle shaking). For membrane fractionation, the resulting spheroplasts were quickly pelleted at 800g, resuspended in 1 ml ice-cold TE (10 mM Tris­HCl pH 7.5, and 1 mM EDTA), and lysed by rapid vortexing31. The suspension was centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min at 800g to remove unlysed cells and the supernatant was centrifuged in a microfuge (14,000g at 4 °C for 10 min) to generate a crude membrane pellet. This pellet was washed once and resuspended in TE, pH 7.5. For native gels, spheroplasts were pelleted and osmotically lysed on ice in native sample buffer (10 mM Tris acetate pH 6.9, 5 mM potassium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromophenol blue and 0.01% xylene cyanol). Samples were then centrifuged to pellet particulate matter, and loaded immediately. Native gels33 used a continuous buffer system of HEPES and imidazole at pH 7.4. Acrylamide gels (6%) were pre-run at a constant 120 V at 4 °C until the current was steady. Buffer was changed before loading of samples, and gels were run for 2 h at 120 V.

Microscopy and immunofluorescence. For examination of Vma2­GFP and Rav1­GFP localization, cells grown in YP­dextrose (pH 5.5) at 30 °C were collected (for Rav1­GFP) or shifted to YP­dextrose (pH 7.5) at 37 °C for 1 h (for Vma2­GFP), and then resuspended in Vectashield mounting medium plus DAPI (Vector Laboratories) supplemented with 2% glucose. Cell suspensions were spotted onto microscope slides, allowed to settle for 5 min, and examined immediately with a ×100 objective (Fig. 5c, e). For immunofluorescence, wild-type and rav1 cells grown in YP­dextrose (pH 5.5) at 25 °C to an aborbance at 600 nm of 0.8­1.0 were shifted to 37 °C for 1 h, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and hybridized with polyclonal anti-Vph1 antibody that was pre-absorbed with vph1 cell extract as described33. Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody was used at 1:1000 as a secondary antibody. For analysis of V-ATPase reassembly, wild-type and rav1 cells expressing Vma2­GFP were treated as described34 (Fig. 5f). At the indicated times, fixative (formaldehyde/glutaraldehyde to final concentrations of 3.7%/0.1%, respectively) was added directly to each culture, and cells were incubated for 30 min. Cells were then collected, resuspended in PBS plus 3.7% formaldehyde, and incubated for a further 6 h. Fixed cells were resuspended in Vectashield mounting medium, and observed using a Leica DM IRB/TCS confocal microscope.
