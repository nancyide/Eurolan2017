Interactions among Three Proteins That Specifically Activate Translation of the Mitochondrial COX3 mRNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

NANCY G. BROWN, MARIA C. COSTANZO, AND THOMAS D. FOX* Section of Genetics and Development, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853-2703 Received 21 July 1993/Returned for modification 9 September 1993/Accepted 11 November 1993 The PET54, PET122, and PET494 proteins, which are associated with the yeast inner mitochondrial membrane, specificaly activate translation of the mitochondrially encoded COX3 mRNA. We used the two-hybrid system to test whether pairs of these proteins, when fused to either the GAL4 DNA-binding or transcriptional activating domain, can physically associate as measured by the expression of the GALAdependent reporter, lacZ. PET54 and PET122 interacted in this system, and an amino-terminally truncated PET494 fragment showed an interaction with PET54. We also detected functional interactions between PET54 and PET122 genetically: a pet54 missense substitution (Phe to Gly at position 244) that caused a severe respiratory defect was suppressed both by a missense substitution affecting PET122 (Gly to Val at position 211) and by overproduction of wild-type PET122. Both Gly and Ala, substituted at PET54 position 244, disrupted the two-hybrid interactions with PET122 and PET494. While Ala at PET54 position 244 caused only a modest respiratory phenotype alone, it caused a severe respiratory defect when combined with a cold-sensitive mitochondrial mutation affecting the COX3 mRNA 5' leader. This synthetic defect was suppressed by a missense substitution in PET122 and by overproduction ofwild-type PET122, indicating functional interactions among PET54, PET122, and the mRNA. Taken together with previous work, these data suggest that a complex containing PET54, PET122, and PET494 mediates the interaction of the COX3 mRNA with mitochondrial ribosomes at the surface of the inner membrane.

Among the many nuclear gene products required for expression of yeast mitochondrial genes are proteins that activate translation of specific mitochondrially encoded mRNAs (1, 5, 14, 34, 48). Three such proteins, PET54, PET122, and PET494, which are associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane (42), are required for translation of the COX3 mRNA encoding cytochrome c oxidase subunit III (8, 12, 13, 17, 39). These proteins activate translation through a site (or sites) that can be mapped genetically to the upstream half of the 613-base COX3 mRNA 5' untranslated leader (15, 19, 56). The yeast mitochondrial translation system has not been amenable to in vitro biochemical analysis (20). However, genetic studies have shed some light on the probable function of mRNA-specific translational activators. The PET122 protein functionally interacts with the mitochondrial ribosome, since mutations that truncate its carboxy terminus can be suppressed by mutations affecting three different proteins of the mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit (29-31, 43). In addition, PET122 interacts functionally with the COX3 mRNA 5' leader, since a cold-sensitive mutation in the COX3 mRNA 5' leader can be suppressed by a mutation affecting PET122 (15). The phenotypic similarities ofpetS4, petl22, andpet494 mutants are consistent with the idea that these three proteins act together to carry out the same function. To date, however, no further definitions of the roles of PET54 and PET494 have been possible, nor has any evidence been reported for interactions among these three activator proteins.

In this study, we have used both the well-known genetic methods of suppressor analysis and phenotypic analysis of double mutants (reviewed in reference 35) and a recently developed strategy termed the two-hybrid system (9, 23) to explore interactions among the translational activator proteins and the COX3 mRNA. The two-hybrid system takes advantage of the fact that the yeast GAL4 protein can activate transcription even when its DNA-binding and transcriptional activation domains are held together by noncovalent interactions. Nuclearly targeted hybrid proteins, consisting of each GALA domain fused to other proteins of interest, can be coexpressed in yeast cells. If the proteins of interest interact physically, then GAL4 activity is reconstituted in vivo and a GAL4-dependent reporter gene, in this case lacZ, is expressed. Thus, interaction between two Our results argue strongly for protein-protein interactions between PET54 and PET122 and between PET54 and PET494. In addition, we present genetic evidence for functional interactions among PET54, PET122, and the COX3 mRNA 5' leader. These findings, taken together with results of earlier studies, support a model in which a membranebound complex of translational activator proteins mediates the interaction of mitochondrial ribosomes with the mRNA.

with lithium acetate and polyethylene glycol (22, 36). Transformants of strain GGY1::171 (26) were plated on complete medium containing all amino acids except those being selected and sucrose as a carbon source (GGY1::171 carries unknown auxotrophic mutations in addition to those listed in Table 1). To score lacZ expression, these transformants mM phosphate buffer and 40 ,ug/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3indolyl-o-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal). Selected transformants were propagated from the original transformation plates. Plasmids. Plasmids were constructed and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5a by using standard techniques (50). The multicopy expression vectors pMA424, encoding the GAL4 DNA-binding domain residues 1 to 147 and bearing HIS3 (23, 41), and pGAD2F, encoding the GAL4 transcriptional activation domain residues 768 to 881 and bearing LEU2 (9), have been described elsewhere. The three translational activator genes were isolated from plasmids by using the PCR (50) with primers containing BamHI sites in order to generate the proper fragments for in-frame cloning into the BamHI sites of pMA424 and cloned gene in M13 mpl9 (18), using the primers 5'HBPET54 (5 'GGTAAGCTTGGATCCCCATGAAGGCTTCTAGTA AAGCT3') and 3'PET54BH (5'GGTAAGCTTGGATCCT

were printed to the same selective medium containing 100

pGAD2F. The PETS4 coding region was copied from the

MOL. CELL. BIOL. inserted into pMA424 and pGAD2F, yielding pNGB7 and pNGB8, respectively. The petS4-G244 and pet54-A244 mutant genes were similarly copied from template plasmids pMC267 and pMC266, respectively (see below), and inserted as HindIII fragments into pAAH5, creating pNGB37 and pNGB36, respectively. The pet54-G244 coding sequence was reisolated from pNGB37 as a BamHI fragment and inserted into pMA424 and pGAD2F, yielding pNGB30 and pNGB31, respectively. The petS4-A244 coding sequence was reisolated from pNGB36 as a BamHI fragment and inserted into pMA424 and pGAD2F, yielding pNGB34 and pNGB35, respectively. The PET122 coding region was copied from pB122-XB1, using the primers 5'HBPET122 (5'GG TAAGCTTGGATCCTGGTGACCACCGATGTGCGG3') and 3'PET122BH (5'GGTAAGCTTGGATCCTITATGTGT TGAT1TCAAA3'). This amplified fragment was inserted as a HindIII fragment into the vector pBluescript (-) (Stratagene). The PET122 coding region was reisolated from this plasmid, pNGB9, as a BamHI fragment and inserted into pMA424 and pGAD2F, yielding pNGB10 and pNGB11, respectively. The PET122-V211 mutant gene clone was similarly amplified from template plasmid pMC286 and inserted as a BamHI fragment directly into pMA424 and pGAD2F, yielding pNGB32 and pNGB33, respectively. The complete PET494 coding region was amplified from pPHB20 (28), using the primers 5'HBPET494 (5'GGTAAGCTTGG ATCCCGATGCAYT1GAAAAAGGGG3') and 3'PET494 BH (5'GGTAAGCTTGGATCCTITrATTAAGAAGAGTC CGCC3'), inserted as a HindIII fragment into pBluescript (-) (Stratagene), and then subcloned into pAAH5 to give pNGB13. The functional PET494 coding region was reisolated from pNGB13 as a BamHI fragment and inserted into pMA424 and pGAD2F, yielding pNGB14 and pNGB15, respectively. A DNA fragment encoding the amino-terminally truncated PET494 protein (lacking 146 residues) was similarly amplified, using 5'BPET494-428 (5'GGTGGATCC AGCAACCTGATGTAGCACAT3') as the upstream primer, and directly inserted as a BamHI fragment into pMA424 and pGAD2F, yielding pNGB38 and pNGB39, respectively.

13-Galactosidase assays. Cultures were grown to saturation in sucrose-containing complete medium lacking histidine and leucine, diluted back into the same medium, and grown to an optical density at 600 nm of -1.0. Cells (1.5 ml) were resuspended in 200 ,ul of buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 20% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed by vortexing (five times for 30 s each time) with 0.45-mm-diameter glass beads, and a clear extract was collected after centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 4°C (49). 1-Galactosidase assays were performed by the method of Miller (45), and protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (6). Immunoblots. Total yeast protein was isolated from overnight cultures as described previously (58), electrophoresed in a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel, and blotted to an Immobilon-P (Millipore) membrane. The membrane was probed with antiserum against PET54 (18) that had been treated with acetone powder (32) derived from yeast cells lacking PET54.

for mutagenesis was 5'CGATFlTATATCTG(G or C)CGA AAAC3', to change codon 244 to GCC (Ala) or GGC (Gly). Progeny phage were screened for a unique BstBI site present in the parental phage but absent in the mutants. Each mutation was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing (51), and the 1.6-kb HindIII fragment carrying each gene was subcloned into pMC216AH, a yeast replicating plasmid carrying the URA3 gene and 1.4 kb of PETS4 flanking sequences but lacking the 1.6-kb HindIII fragment. The resulting plasmids were pMC266 (petS4-A244) and pMC267 (petS4-G244). The mutant genes were integrated into the chromosome at the PETS4 locus by excising them from pMC266 and pMC267 as approximately 3-kb fragments and using the gel-purified fragments to transform the pet54-5 complete deletion strain MCC87 (18) (Table 1), along with the URA3 replicating plasmid pCGE137 (47) to provide a selectable marker. Ura+ transformants were screened for the ability to grow on YPEG, and integration was checked by DNA gel blot analysis (50). The followingpetS4 mutations were used to characterize the allele specificity of the PET122-V211 suppressor. pet54-4 is a frameshift mutation caused by a single-base-pair deletion in the PETS4 coding sequence, and petS4-S is a complete deletion of the PETS4 coding sequence (18). petS4-20 is an uncharacterized mutation causing temperature-sensitive respiration (52). The temperature-sensitive mutationpet54-21 is a revertant of the pet54-4 frameshift mutation with a singlebase-pair insertion upstream ofpet54-4, resulting in a PET54 protein with 30 amino acids of altered sequence (18). The temperature-sensitive mutation petS4-ts2341 (44) is a T-to-A change at position +23 of the coding sequence, changing codon 8 from isoleucine to asparagine (7). Selection and analysis of suppressor mutations. Respiring revertants were selected on YPEG medium at 30°C from two mutant strains: apetS4-G244 mutant (MCC137; Table 1) and a petS4-A244 [cox3-1S] (notations in brackets represent mitochondrial genotypes) double-mutant strain (MCC215; Table 1). The MCC137 revertants were analyzed as follows. First, they were treated with ethidium bromide (25) to remove mitochondrial DNA. The resulting rhoo derivatives were crossed to a wild-type strain (DL1; Table 1), and the respiratory phenotypes of the meiotic progeny were analyzed to determine whether the suppressor phenotype resulted from a mitochondrial or nuclear mutation and, if nuclear, whether the mutation was linked to petS4. Of 26 suppressor strains analyzed, none carried mitochondrial mutations, 6 carried nuclear mutations linked to petS4, and the remaining 20 had nuclear mutations unlinked to petS4. To determine whether any of those 20 strains carried suppressor mutations linked to PET122, they were crossed to the petS4-G244 petl22-6 mutant strain MCC223 (Table 1), which had been transformed with the PETS4 URA3 replicating plasmid pAF001 (15). (The plasmid was necessary because the respiration of the homozygous petS4-G244, heterozygous suppressor strains was not strong enough to promote efficient sporulation.) After dissection, the meiotic progeny were printed twice to medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid to select against the plasmid (4) and then to YPEG medium to analyze the segregation of respiratory phenotypes. Of the 20 revertants analyzed, one (MCC137R52; Table 1) carried a suppressor mutation tightly linked to petl22-6 (no recombinants in 46 complete tetrads). Eleven of the remaining nineteen revertants were analyzed in a similar manner to test linkage of their suppressor mutations to PET494, and none was linked to PET494. Of these 19 uncharacterized suppressors, only 3 had intrinsic phenotypes: one caused a very slight temperature-sensitive respiratory defect, and two were temperature-sensitive lethal mutations. At least some of these mutations are likely to be informational suppressors. Revertants of the pet54-A244 [cox3-1S] strain MCC215 were analyzed as follows. They were first crossed to a ble 1), and the respiratory growth of the meiotic progeny was analyzed to place the suppressor mutations in one of two categories: either mitochondrial or nuclear, at petS4, or nuclear and unlinked topetS4. One mutation of nine fell into the first group, while the remaining eight were in the second group. To determine whether these suppressor mutations were in PET122, the eight revertant strains were crossed to a petS4-A244 petJ22-6 [cox3-1S] strain (MCC246; Table 1) containing PETS4 on pAF001. After curing of the meiotic progeny of the plasmid on 5-fluoro-orotic acid medium (4), segregation of the suppressor phenotype was scored. Two of the eight revertant strains (MCC215R4-1 and MCC215R7-1; Table 1) carried suppressor mutations tightly linked to PET122 (no recombinants in 44 and 54 complete tetrads, respectively). Cloning and analysis of PET122 suppressor alleles. The PET122 suppressor mutant genes were isolated from strains MCC137R5-2 (PET122-V211), MCC215R4-1 (PET122-I175), and MCC215R7-1 (PET122-IH75), using the PCR as described above. The template was total genomic DNA isolated from 1-ml cultures (53) and digested with Sal. The primers used for amplification were 5'HPET122 (5'GGTA AGCITATGTTGACTATCACGAAAAG3') and 3'PET122 BH (see above). Amplified fragments were digested with HindIII or with HindIII and BamHI and inserted into pBluescript (-) (Stratagene). Nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxy-chain termination method (51). For strain MCC137R5-2, a partial nucleotide sequence of the total PCR products was determined to verify that the singlenucleotide change observed in the cloned gene was present in the bulk reaction products. RESULTS Evidence for interactions among the COX3 mRNA-specific translational activator proteins, using the two-hybrid system. We first sought to test whether interactions between pairs of the translational activator proteins PET54, PET122, and PET494 could bring together the separated DNA-binding and transcriptional activation domains of GALA in the nucleus. Plasmids encoding proteins consisting of the translational activators fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 or to the transcriptional activating domain of GAL4 were constructed in the multicopy expression vector pMA424 (23, 41) or pGAD2F (9), respectively (Materials and Methods). The entire PETS4 coding sequence was used in the fusions, as PET54 is not processed during import into mitochondria (42). Since PET122 is cleaved during import between residues 8 and 9 of the precursor (42), the PET122 fusions were constructed to begin coding at residue 9 (coincidentally, the fusions reconstituted the eighth codon). Since the site of cleavage of the 56-kDa PET494 precursor protein is unknown, we constructed two pairs of PET494 fusions. One pair contained the entire PET494 reading frame. In the other pair of PET494 fusions, bases 1 through 428 were removed such that the PET494 sequence began at amino acid residue 147. The deleted portion of pre-PET494 included a

33-amino-acid region known to be dispensable for function (16). To confirm that no inactivating mutations arose in the genes during plasmid construction, we checked whether expression of the fusion proteins would complement the respiratory growth-defective phenotypes of petS4, petl22, and pet494 chromosomal mutations. All of the fusion proteins (or proteolytic products derived in vivo from them) functioned in mitochondria by this criterion, although the complementation observed with the PET54 fusions and the amino-terminally truncated PET494 fusions was weak. Thus, despite the absence of mitochondrial targeting signals at their amino termini (and the presence of nuclear targeting signals in the fusions), some active protein entered mitochondria in each case. An important prerequisite for the detection of interactions with the two-hybrid system is that the individual fusion proteins must not alone activate expression of the GAL4dependent lacZ reporter gene in the host strain GGY1::171. Each of the plasmids encoding fusion proteins was transformed into the host, and (-galactosidase activity in the transformants was analyzed both by colony color on selective medium containing X-Gal and biochemically in cell extracts. None of the fusion proteins was able to activate transcription (Table 2). To test for interactions, pairs of fusion proteins were expressed together in the host strain, and 0-galactosidase activity was analyzed (Table 2). The results indicated protein-protein interactions between PET54 and PET122 and between PET54 and PET494. The highest level of 1-galactosidase activity was detected in cells containing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to PET122 and the GAL4 activation domain fused to PET54. While PET54 and PET122

MOL. CELL. BIOL. interacted in the reverse orientation as well, the P-galactosidase activity was consistently about eightfold lower. Low but significant ,B-galactosidase activity was also detected in cells expressing fusions containing PET54 and the aminoterminally truncated form of PET494. None of the other combinations tested, including self-interactions, yielded positive results. Missense mutations in codon 244 of PET54 affect COX3 translational activation. We obtained further evidence for functional interaction between PET54 and PET122 (as well as between PET54 and the COX3 mRNA leader) from studies using site-directed petS4 missense mutations at codon 244, which were suggested by a similarity to the bacteriophage T4 translational repressor protein RegA (55). RegA can be photochemically cross-linked to nucleic acid at Phe-106, suggesting that the region around this residue comes into close contact with mRNA (55) (although determinants for RNA binding specificity may lie elsewhere [37]). A search ofprotein sequence data bases with the amino acid sequence of this 17-residue region of RegA revealed several proteins with similar regions, among them PET54 (55). Although PET54 and RegA are not similar overall, this short region of PET54 has amino acid sequence similarity to RegA (7 identities in a 17-amino-acid overlap) in the region surrounding Phe-106, including a Phe residue at position 244 that could correspond to Phe-106 of RegA. To investigate the functional importance of this region, we changed the PETS4 Phe codon at 244 to Ala (petS4-A244) and to Gly (petS4-G244) codons (Materials and Methods). Both alleles, carried on high-copy-number plasmids, supported respiration in a petS4 deletion strain, demonstrating that neither mutation completely destroyed PET54 activity. To analyze the phenotypes of these mutations in an otherwise wild-type situation, we replaced a complete petS4 deletion with each missense allele by integrative transformation (Materials and Methods). Both chromosomal mutations reduced respiratory growth, but to different extents. petS4A244 had a modest effect on respiration, causing a slight heat-sensitive defect: strain MCC135 (Table 1) grew like the wild type on YPEG medium at 13.5 and 16°C but less well than the wild type at 30 and 37°C. petS4-G244 had a more severe heat-sensitive phenotype: strain MCC137 (Table 1) grew poorly on YPEG at 13.5 and 16°C, very poorly at 30°C, and not at all at 370C. Suppression ofpet54 missense mutations at codon 244 by a PET122 missense mutation. To search for mutations in genes encoding components of the COX3 translational activation complex that interact with PET54, we selected spontaneous revertants of the petS4-G244 strain MCC137 (Table 1) on YPEG at 30°C. Since this missense mutation altered a putative RNA-binding domain of PET54, we anticipated that suppressor mutations might occur in the COX3 5' untranslated leader region. However, while apetS4 missense mutation at codon 244 did provide us with some evidence for PET54-COX3 mRNA interaction (see below), none of the petS4-G244 suppressors proved to be in the mitochondrial genome (Materials and Methods). The revertants were analyzed genetically to determine whether any suppressors were linked to PET122 (Materials and Methods). Of 26 nuclear suppressors analyzed, one (in strain MCC137R5-2; Table 1) was tightly linked to PET122. (None of the suppressors analyzed was linked to PET494 [Materials and Methods].) The PET122 structural gene was copied from genomic DNAofthis revertant strain byusing the PCR (Materials and Methods), and its nucleotide sequence was determined. One difference from the wild-type sequence was found: a G-to-T

We tested the allele specificity of this suppressor by crossing it to several other pet54 mutant strains and analyzing the respiratory phenotypes of the meiotic progeny. PET122-V211 failed to supfailed to suppress three temperature-sensitive mutations, petS4-ts2341 (44) (see Materials and Methods),petS4-20 (52), andpet54-21 (18). However, it did suppress the mild phenotype of apetS4-A244 strain: respiratory growth of a PET122from that of the wild type (not shown). The pet54-G244 mutation is suppressed by overproduction of the wild-type PET122 protein. Since several lines of evidence suggested that the PET122 and PET54 proteins tested the effect of overproducing the wild-type PET122 G244 mutation. Overproduction of the PET122 protein does not suppress petS4 null mutations, nor does it cause a detectable phenotype in wild-type cells (15). However, transformation of the petS4-G244 strain MCC247 with a plasmid (pEAD122 [42]) carrying PET122 under control of the ADCI promoter (3) strongly suppressed its respiratory wild-type level at 30°C (Fig. 1). In contrast, transformation affect its respiratory growth (not shown). Disruption of two-hybrid interactions by mutations in codon 244 ofPETS4. IfpetS4 mutations affecting codon 244 produce respiratory growth phenotypes by weakening the interaction between the PET54 and PET122 proteins, then these mutations should also affect the interaction in the two-hybrid system.

Both pet54 mutations disrupted the interaction between PET54 and PET122, as no ,B-galactosidase was produced in these cells (Table 3). The petS4 mutations did not cause the PET54 fusion proteins to become unstable in vivo, since immunoblot analysis showed that the mutant proteins accumulated to levels comparable to those of the wild-type PET54 fusions (Fig. 2). Thus, the PET54 wild-type residue Phe-244 is apparently important for the physical interaction between the PET54 and PET122 fusion proteins. The PET122-V211 suppressor protein, which does not affect respiratory growth in otherwise wild-type strains, was also tested in the two-hybrid system. Its interaction with wildtype PET54 was indistinguishable from that of wild-type PET122 protein (Table 3). However, this suppressor protein failed to interact detectably with the mutant PET54 proteins in the two-hybrid system, despite its ability to compensate for the mutant PET54 proteins in mitochondria. We also tested for interaction of both mutant PET54 proteins with the amino-terminally truncated form of PET494 (Table 3). Bothpet54 mutations disrupted the wildtype interaction, as no 3-galactosidase was produced when

FIG. 3. Synthetic respiratory defect in a petS4-A244 [cox3-1S] strain. Strains were streaked on a YPEG plate (see Materials and Methods) and incubated at 30°C for 7 days. (A) A PET54 [cox3-15] strain (MCC199); (B) pet54-A244 [cox3-15] (MCC213); (C) petS4A244 [COX3] (MCC135); (D) PETS4 [COX3] (wild type; DL2); (E) PETS4 [cox2-10] (JJM196); (F) pet54-A244 [cox2-10] (MCC258). either of the mutant PET54 fusion proteins was combined with the truncated PET494 fusion proteins. The pet54-A244 missense mutation in combination with a cox3 5' untranslated leader mutation causes a synthetic respiratory defect. The nuclear mutation petS4-A244 causes a very modest reduction in respiratory growth at 30°C (Fig. 3). Since this mutation affected a possible RNA-binding domain of PET54 (see above), we tested whether it might interact synergistically, in double-mutant strains, with mitochondrial mutations that alter the COX3 mRNA 5' leader. One such mitochondrial mutation is cox3-15 (a deletion of nucleotides -437 to -359 and -329 to -1 [15]), which causes coldsensitive cytochrome c oxidase subunit III synthesis but allows moderate respiratory growth at 30°C (Fig. 3). Indeed, a petS4-A244 [cox3-15] double mutant strain was unable to respire at 30°C (Fig. 3) or any other tested temperature. As a control, we constructed a double-mutant strain carrying bothpetS4-A244 and the mitochondrial cox2-10 allele. cox210, an in vitro-made mutation changing the AUG initiation codon of the COX2 gene to AUA, causes a leaky respirationdefective phenotype (46). The petS4-A244 mutation did not interact synergistically with cox2-10: respiratory growth of a petS4-A244 [cox2-10] strain was indistinguishable from that of a PETS4 [cox2-10] strain (Fig. 3). Thus, the synthetic defect of the petS4-A244 [cox3-15] strain appears to be specific, suggesting that the PET54 protein interacts functionally with the 5' untranslated leader of the COX3 mRNA. The petS4-A244 [cox3-151 synthetic phenotype can be suppressed by a PET122 missense mutation and by overproduction of the wild-type PET122 protein. We selected spontaneous respiring revertants of a petS4-A244 [cox3-1S] strain, MCC215 (Table 1), at 30°C and analyzed them genetically (Materials and Methods). Two of nine independently isolated revertants (MCC215R4-1 and MCC215R7-1; Table 1 and Fig. 4) had suppressor mutations tightly linked to PET122. The PET122 structural genes from these revertants were copied by the PCR, and their nucleotide sequences were determined. Both genes carried the same single-nucleotide difference from the wild-type PET122 gene: a G-to-A change at position +525, which would change codon 175 from ATG, encoding methionine, to ATA, encoding isoleucine. We have termed this partially dominant suppressor allele PET122-H175.

FIG. 4. Suppression of the synthetic respiratory defect in a pet54-A244 [cox3-1S] strain by the PET122-I175 mutation and by overproduction of the wild-type PET122 protein. Strains were streaked on a YPEG plate (see Materials and Methods) and incubated at 30°C for 12 days. (A) A petS4-A244 [cotx3-1S] strain (MCC215); (B) a petS4-A244 [cox3-1S] strain carrying the PET1221175 suppressor (MCC215R7-1); (C) wild type (DL2); (D) a petS4A244 [cox3-15] strain (MCC248) carrying a plasmid (pEAD122 [42]) overexpressing PET122.

To analyze further the function of the PET122-I175 allele, we placed it in a wild-type background and in combination with each of the single mutationspetS4-A244 and cox3-15. In an otherwise wild-type background, PET122-I175 had no detectable phenotype: respiratory growth of a PET122-I175 strain was indistinguishable from that of the wild type at 13.5, 16, 30, or 37°C (not shown). Interestingly, while PET122-1l75 had a significant effect on the respiratory growth of a petS4-A244 [cax3-15] double mutant (Fig. 4), it failed to suppress efficiently either of the single mutations. Respiratory growth of a PET122-I175 petS4-A244 [COX3] strain was indistinguishable from that of a PET122 petS4A244 [COX3] strain at all temperatures tested except 37°C; at this temperature, the PET122-Il75 petS4-A244 [COX3] colonies were slightly larger, indicating very weak suppression (not shown). A PET122-1l75 PETS4 [cox3-1S] strain grew on YPEG medium like a nuclearly wild-type, [cox3-15] control strain at 30 or 37°C (15) but at low temperature (16°C) actually grew more slowly than the control (not shown). Overproduction of the wild-type PET122 protein also suppressed the phenotype of apetS4-A244 [cox3-15] doublemutant strain (Fig. 4), although it is known not to affect the respiratory growth of a PETS4 [cox3-JS] single-mutant strain (15). However, overproduction of PET494 did not suppress the double-mutant strain (not shown). DISCUSSION The primary conclusion of this report is that the three proteins known to activate translation of the mitochondrial COX3 mRNA interact with each other and thus probably work together to carry out the same function. Our present data indicate physical and functional interactions between PET54 and PET122 and physical interaction between PET54 and PET494. They also point to a functional interaction between PET54 and the COX3 mRNA 5' leader. Taken together with results of previous work on this system (15, 29-31, 42, 43), our data suggest the picture depicted in Fig. 5, where a complex containing the membrane-bound proteins PET54, PET122, and PET494 mediates the interaction of mitochondrial ribosomes with the COX3 mRNA 5' leader,

FIG. 5. Hypothetical model depicting functional interactions, established here and in previous work, among components involved in translation of the COX3 mRNA within mitochondria. Data in this report establish interactions between the COX3 mRNA-specific activator proteins PET54 and PET122 as well as between PET54 and PET494. They also support a functional interaction between PET54 and the COX3 mRNA 5' untranslated leader. PET122 has been shown previously to interact functionally both with the COX3 mRNA 5' leader (15) and with proteins of the mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit (29-31, 43). The PET54, PET122, and PET494 proteins have been shown to be associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane (42). Suggestive evidence, from overexpression studies, for interactions between PET494 and PET122 and between PET494 and the COX3 mRNA 5' leader (15) has not been interpreted in this figure.

How mitochondrial riboHowever, they employ a homolog of the E. coli initiation factor 2 (54) and apparently identify the start site by recognition of both AUG and some other context information (24, 46). Our evidence for physical interactions between proteins somes initiate protein synthesis is not known in any detail.

was obtained by using the two-hybrid system (9, 23), in which the ability of two proteins to bind to each other is revealed by their ability to bring together the separated domains of the transcriptional activator GALA. We have presented our data on GALA-activated reporter gene expression (,B-galactosidase specific activities) quantitatively. not determined solely by the affinities of the proteins of interest for each other. We observed an eightfold difference in the signals resulting from PET54 and PET122 interaction, depending on the orientation of these two proteins with respect to the GAL4 DNA-binding and transcriptional activation domains (Tables 2 and 3). Many factors, in addition to the strength of binding between the two proteins of interest,

However, differences in the magnitudes of these signals are

play a role in the activity of the reconstituted GAL4. For

example, fusion of some proteins to DNA-binding domains conformational, steric, and stability phenomena must strongly influence the observed reporter gene activity in unpredictable ways. Thus, weak but reproducible signals may bejust as meaningful as strong signals. Indeed, it is very cannot be interpreted to mean that two proteins fail to interact. All of the proteins encoded by our gene fusions had detectable biological activity in mitochondria when highly

can reduce DNA-binding activity (27). These and other

important to realize that the absence of a detectable signal

expressed: they complemented, at least weakly, the nonrespiratory phenotype of the corresponding chromosomal deletion mutations. Similar GAL4 fusion proteins have previously been shown to function in complementation tests (11). While our results suggest that the translational activator moieties of the fusion proteins adopt normal conformations, it is possible that the biologically active species lack the amino-terminally located GAL4 domains as a result of proteolysis. Import of most proteins into mitochondria is directed by amino-terminal targeting signals that are proteolytically processed (33, 48). While none of our fusion proteins have mitochondrial targeting sequences at their amino termini, the proteolytic processing sites are at least potentially present in the PET122 fusions and the PET494 fusions that contain the entire protein (PET54 is not proteolytically processed during import) (12, 42). In any event, the fact that some fraction of active protein entered mitochondria is not surprising, since high-level expression has previously been shown to drive other proteins lacking amino-terminal targeting signals into mitochondria (10, 21). Our genetic evidence for functional interactions among PET54, PET122, and the COX3 mRNA 5' leader is based on site-directed mutations affecting the PET54 codon specifying Phe-244. This Phe residue lies in a short region exhibiting sequence similarity to the phage T4 RegA protein (55), which acts as a translational repressor for a specific subset of T4 mRNAs by binding to their translation initiation regions (2, 38, 57). PET54 Phe-244 appears to correspond to RegA Phe-106, which can be cross-linked to nucleic acid (55). Substitution of Ala for PET54 Phe-244 (petS4MA244) produced a very modest respiratory defect in an otherwise wild-type strain. However, consistent with the notion that this region of PET54 might be in close proximity to RNA, we observed a strong synthetic defective phenotype when petS4-A244 was combined with a cold-sensitive mitochondrial mutation (cox3-1S) affecting the COX3 mRNA 5' leader (Fig. 3). The possibility of intimate interactions among PET54, PET122, and the mRNA is suggested by the fact that this synthetic defect was suppressed both by overexpression of wild-type PET122 and by a chromosomal missense mutation, PET122-1175 (Fig. 4), which failed to suppress significantly either petS4-A244 or cox3-15 as single mutations (indeed, it slightly enhanced the phenotype of the mRNA leader mutation). Substitution of Gly for Phe-244 (petS4G244) produced a severe respiratory defect but did not completely eliminate function. Confirming the idea that PET54 and PET122 interact, petS4-G244 was allele specifically suppressed by the Gly-to-Val missense mutation PET122-V211. petS4-G244 was also suppressed by overproduction of wild-type PET122 protein. Taken together, these results suggest that the substitutions at PET54 position 244 weakened the protein's ability to interact with PET122 and probably with the COX3 mRNA 5' leader. The pairwise protein-protein interactions detected in the nucleus by two-hybrid experiments are apparently more easily disrupted by mutations affecting PET54 residue 244 than are the functional interactions occurring in the putative translational activation complex within mitochondria. While the petS4-A244 mutation had only a modest effect on respiratory growth (Fig. 3), the same substitution eliminated the interactions with both PET122 and PET494 detectable by the two-hybrid experiment (Table 3) despite the fact that the mutant PET54-containing fusion proteins accumulated at normal steady-state levels (Fig. 2). As expected, the phenotypically more severe petS4-G244 mutation also disrupted the two-hybrid interaction, but its suppressor, PET122-

V211, failed to restore the two-hybrid interaction despite its ability to restore significant translational activation in mitochondria. We hypothesize that in mitochondria, multifaceted interactions among these proteins and the mRNA serve to stabilize complexes containing mutant PET54 proteins. However, residual binding of mutant PET54 proteins to PET122 (both wild-type and suppressor forms) and to PET494 in strictly pairwise combinations is too weak to reconstitute significant GAL4 activity in the two-hybrid system.
