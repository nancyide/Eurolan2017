SUMMARY In budding yeast, SCF complexes, composed of Skp1, Cdc53 and one of the F-box proteins, have been implicated in Cdc34-dependent ubiquitination. Grr1, which is required for degradation of G1 cyclins Cln1 and Cln2 as well as for regulation of glucose repression, is an F-box protein and interacts with Skp1 through the F-box motif. Grr1 also interacts in vitro with phosphorylated Cln1 and Cln2. However, ubiquitination of Cln1 has not been successful in an in vitro reconstituted system. In this study, domain analysis was performed to understand the role of Grr1 in the degradation of Cln2. Grr1 has another motif, leucine-rich repeats (LRR), in addition to the F-box. We found that the LRR is a domain for Cln2 binding. A deletion of half of the LRR abolished the interaction of

Grr1 with phosphorylated Cln2 but not with Skp1 in vivo, and a deletion of the F-box abolished the interaction of Grr1 with Skp1 but not with phosphorylated Cln2 in vivo. Based on these results, we constructed grr1 mutants that are defective in association with either Skp1 or Cln2. Cln2 was highly stabilized and accumulated in the phosphorylated forms in the mutant cells. Furthermore, Skp1 associated in vivo with phosphorylated Cln2 in a Grr1-dependent manner. These data suggest that Grr1 is required for degradation of Cln2 through linking phosphorylated Cln2 to Skp1 in a SCFGrr1 complex.

INTRODUCTION Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) regulate cell cycle progression. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the G1 cyclins Cln1, Cln2 and Cln3 regulate entry into Start by activating the Cdc28 protein kinase (Reed, 1992). The three cyclins are not fully equivalent. Cln3 is an upstream regulator of the others and activates transcription of Cln1 and Cln2 after monitoring growth and size of cells (Tyers et al., 1993). Cln1 and Cln2 activate their own transcription by a positive-feedback mechanism (Cross and Tinkelenberg, 1991; Dirick and Nasmyth, 1991; Ogas et al., 1991). This oscillation activates more Cdc28 and then leads to rapid and irreversible passage through Start. Another role of G1 cyclins is for degradation of Sic1, an S phase Cdk inhibitor (Dirick et al., 1995; Schneider et al., 1996; Tyers, 1996). Sic1 accumulates from late mitosis until late G1 phase and prevents S phase entry by inhibiting the activity of S-phase Cdk (Mendenhall, 1993; Schwob et al., 1994). G1 cyclin-directed Cdc28 phosphorylates Sic1 at late G1 phase (Verma et al., 1997a). Phosphorylated Sic1 is then ubiquitinated and forwarded to proteolytic breakdown, which allows cells to enter S phase (Schwob et al., 1994; Verma et al., 1997a,b). Levels of Cln2 protein are also regulated by a ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (Deshaies et al., 1995). Degradation of proteins by a ubiquitin/proteasome system regulates various cellular processes (Ciechanover, 1994; Jentsch and Schlenker, 1995). In this system, ubiquitin is first activated by a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), and then the activated ubiquitin is transferred to one of the ubiquitinconjugating enzymes (E2s), which exist as family proteins. Finally, activated ubiquitin is transferred to substrates by either E2 alone, or by E2 in combination with a ubiquitin-ligase E3. The resulting polyubiquitinated substrates are targeted to 26S proteasome for destruction. Cdc34, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) that is required after Start and just before the initiation of DNA replication (Goebl et al., 1988), is responsible for the ubiquitination of phosphorylated Sic1 (Schwob et al., 1994; Verma et al., 1997a). Other proteins such as Cdc4, Skp1 and Cdc53 are also involved in the ubiquitination of Sic1 (Bai et al., 1996; Feldman et al., 1997; Skowyra et al., 1997; Verma et al., 1997b). cdc4, skp1 or cdc53 mutants show a phenotype similar to that of cdc34. They arrest in G1 phase, because of a failure to degrade Sic1. CDC4 encodes a protein with an F-box motif (Bai et al., 1996), which is found in a series of Skp1-interacting proteins. Actually, Cdc4 was shown to interact with Skp1 through the F-box (Bai et al., 1996). Skp1 also interacts with Cdc53 (Feldman et al., 1997; Patton et al., 1998; Skowyra et al., 1997). Thus, the three proteins form a complex. The complex has been shown to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Feldman et al., 1997;


3656 T. Kishi and F. Yamao Skowyra et al., 1997). That is, the complex, now designated as SCFCdc4 (Skp1, Cdc53 and F-box protein Cdc4) (Skowyra et al., 1997), associates with Cdc34 (a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme) and phosphorylated Sic1 (a substrate for ubiquitination) through Cdc53 and Cdc4, respectively. Furthermore, Cdc4, Cdc53 and Skp1 produced in insect cells can support the ubiquitination of Sic1, when supplemented with E1, ubiquitin and Cdc34 (Feldman et al., 1997; Skowyra et al., 1997). Degradation of Cln1 and Cln2 also requires Skp1 and Cdc53 (Bai et al., 1996; Willems et al., 1996). Cdc4, however, is not required for degradation of Cln1 and Cln2 (Blondel and Mann, 1996; Patton et al., 1998). Instead, it has been suggested that another F-box protein Grr1 is required (Barral et al., 1995; Kishi et al., 1998; Li and Johnston, 1997; Patton et al., 1998; Skowyra et al., 1997). GRR1 has been identified as a gene that regulates turnover of G1 cyclins (Barral et al., 1995) as well as glucose repression (Flick and Johnston, 1991). Previously, we isolated grr1 alleles as extragenic suppressors of cdc34 sic1 double mutants (Kishi et al., 1998). Grr1 interacts with Skp1 in an F-box dependent manner (Kishi et al., 1998; Li and Johnston, 1997). Grr1 also interacts with phosphorylated Cln1 and Cln2 in vitro (Skowyra et al., 1997). However, the biological role of these interactions has not been clarified, since in vitro experiments using Cdc53, Skp1 and Grr1 (SCFGrr1) have failed to ubiquitinate phosphorylated Cln1 (Skowyra et al., 1997). Therefore, in this study, we intended to compare the stability of Cln2 in grr1 mutants defective in association with Skp1 or Cln2. We first determined the region of Grr1 responsible for binding Skp1 or Cln2. Based on this analysis, strains with a grr1 allele defective in binding Skp1 or Cln2 were constructed. We found that Cln2 was highly stabilized in those mutants. Thus, the association of Grr1 with Skp1 and with Cln2 is essential for degradation of Cln2.

GRR1-FLAG was constructed by inserting GRR1, which was amplified by PCR primers GAGGATCCATAATATCGGGCG, between the BamHI and SalI sites in pYES2-FLAG. To construct YC111G-GRR1-FLAG, the expression cassette of pYES2GRR1-FLAG was inserted into YCplac111 (Gietz and Sugino, 1988). pYES2-GST was used for the production of Gst fusion proteins, and was constructed by inserting GST in pGEX-2T (Pharmacia) downstream of the GAL1 promoter of pYES2-FLAG. All GST-GRR1 fusions were constructed by inserting DNA fragments, which were amplified by PCR with GRR1-FLAG, GRR1-dF-FLAG or GRR1-dLFLAG as a template using primers GAGGATCCATAATGGATCAGGATAACAAC and TAGTCGACTAACATATCTTCATCGGGCG, between the BamHI and SalI sites in pYES2-GST. To construct GST-SKP1, an SKP1 fragment amplified by PCR using primers GCGGATCCATGGTGACTTCTAATGTTGT and TCGGATCCAAGGATCACAGTCATCAGA was inserted into the BamHI site in pYES2-GST. To tag Arg-Gly-Ser-hexahistidine (RGSHis6), SKP1 was first cloned into pRSETA (Invitrogen), giving pRSETA-SKP1. An NdeIXhoI fragment containing tagged SKP1 from the plasmid was cloned downstream of the GAL1 promoter on YC111G (Kishi et al., 1998), giving YC111G-RGShis6-SKP1. pMT290 (Willems et al., 1996), which carries GAL-CLN2-3xHA, was a kind gift of Dr H. Kobayashi. A fragment of pMT290 containing GAL-CLN2-3xHA was inserted into the SmaI site in YCplac22 (Gietz and Sugino, 1988), giving YC22G-CLN2-HA. Binding assay of Grr1-Skp1 and Grr1-Cln2 Cells grown to late-exponential phase in CM-dropout medium containing raffinose were diluted into fresh CM-dropout medium containing raffinose and galactose to an OD600 of 0.2, and cultivated until they reached an OD600 of 0.5. After pelleting, cells were lysed as described (Tyers et al., 1992). Protein concentration in the lysate was determined by a dye binding assay (Pierce). Lysates typically contained 1-2 mg/ml of total proteins. Cell lysates were normalized to contain the same concentration of total proteins in each experiment. Gst-fusion protein and associated proteins were purified by adding 50 µl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (50% slurry) to the lysates and then rocking them at 4°C for 1 hour. After washing with lysis buffer (Tyers et al., 1992), proteins bound to the beads were immunoblotted with anti-Gst (Boehringer), anti-RGSHis4 (Qiagen) and anti-HA (clone 3F10, Boehringer) antibodies. Gels of 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide were used, unless otherwise indicated. Cln2 decay assay Cells with YC22G-CLN2-HA were grown to exponential phase in CM-dropout medium containing raffinose at 25°C. When they reached an A600 of 0.5, galactose was added to 2% for 1 hour to induce expression of CLN2-HA, and then cells were pelleted, washed, and resuspended in CM dropout medium containing glucose for the indicated timecourse as described (Patton et al., 1998), except that cells were resuspended in the medium at 25°C. Samples were lysed with glass beads and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody (clone 3F10, Boehringer).

Complete minimal (CM) dropout medium was used in the presence of a 2% carbon source (glucose, raffinose or galactose). Plasmid constructions pYES2-GRR1 and pYES2-GRR1-dF have been previously described (Kishi et al., 1998). GRR1-dL was constructed by deleting the sequence from positions +1,648 to +2,130 (ATG=+1) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-mediated mutagenesis. pYES2-FLAG was used for the construction of FLAG-tagged genes, and was constructed by inserting a DNA fragment containing the sequence encoding FLAG peptide of pFLAG-CTC (Kodak) downstream of the GAL1 promoter of pYES2 (Invitrogen). pYES2-

RESULTS F-box and leucine-rich repeats are required for Grr1 functions We tried to obtain grr1 mutants defective in their interaction with either Skp1 or Cln2, and then compare the stability of Cln2 in each mutant with that in wild-type cells. To this end, we first performed domain analysis of Grr1 to dissect the


Grr1 links Cln2 to Skp1 during Cln2 degradation 3657 These genes were placed in the downstream of the GAL1 promoter of pYES2 (Invitrogen). grr1 mutants show cold-sensitive growth. They grow slowly with elongated cell morphology even at their permissive temperatures (Flick and Johnston, 1991). To examine whether GST-GRR1 is able to complement the grr1 phenotype, the GSTGRR1 construct as well as the empty GST vector was transformed into grr1::LEU2 cells (TK-61). The recovery of the transformants from the cold-sensitivity and slow growth at 30°C was examined. Even the low level expression of GSTGRR1 in the presence of glucose was able to complement the cold-sensitivity at 17°C as well as the slow growth at 30°C, while expression of GST alone was not (Fig. 1B). However, microscopic examination showed that GST-GRR1 was not able to remedy the morphological defect of the mutants even when overproduced (data not shown). GST-GRR1-dF or GST-GRR1-dL was not able to complement any defects of the grr1 mutants (Fig. 1B). This suggests that both the F-box and the LRR are essential for Grr1 functions. Grr1-Cln2 association is dependent on the leucinerich repeats but not on the F-box Grr1 interacts with phosphorylated Cln1 and Cln2 in vitro (Skowyra et al., 1997). However, whether Grr1 binds Cln1 and Cln2 in vivo has not been tested. Therefore, we first examined whether Cln2 associates with Grr1 in vivo. Extracts were prepared from cells producing Cln2 tagged with three tandem repeats of the influenza virus hemagglutinin epitope (Cln2HA), together with Gst-fused Grr1 (Gst-Grr1). After mixing with glutathione-Sepharose beads, bead-bound proteins were analyzed by western blots using anti-HA and anti-Gst antibodies. The anti-Gst antibody we used could not consistently detect Gst-Grr1 and its derivatives in yeast lysates. However, Gst-Grr1 and its derivatives were indeed produced, since they were detected by immunoblotting of bead-bound proteins with anti-Gst antibody (Fig. 2A). Gst-Grr1 co-purified with Cln2-HA, whereas Gst alone did not (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and

(B) An equal number of the grr1::LEU2 (TK-61) cells transformed with a plasmid for the expression of the indicated GST fusion proteins were spotted onto the CM-ura-leu plates with glucose or with galactose, and incubated at 17°C for 7 days or at 30°C for 2 days. region that is responsible for its association with Skp1 or Cln2. Grr1 has two recognizable motifs: the F-box (Bai et al., 1996), and the leucine-rich repeats (LRR) (Flick and Johnston, 1991). To determine whether these motifs are required for its association with Skp1 or Cln2, GST fusions were constructed encoding either full-length GRR1 (GST-GRR1) or truncated GRR1 lacking the nucleotide sequence coding for the F-box (GST-GRR1-dF) or half of the LRR (GST-GRR1-dL) (Fig. 1A).

(A) Proteins purified by glutathione-Sepharose beads (left panel) from lysates (right panel) of grr1::LEU2 cells (TK-61) carrying YC22G-CLN2-HA in combination with pYES2-GST-GRR1 (lanes 1 and 5), pYES2-GST-GRR1-dF (lanes 2 and 6), pYES2-GSTGRR1-dL (lanes 3 and 7) or pYES2-GST (lanes 4 and 8) were immunoblotted with anti-HA or anti-Gst antibody. Since the antibody against Gst did not consistently detect Gst-Grr1, Gst-Grr1-dF and GstGrr1-dL in lysates, the panel was omitted. (B) Lysates from grr1::LEU2 cells (TK-61) carrying YC22GCLN2-HA as well as pYES2-GST-GRR1 were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose beads, and then beadbound proteins were subjected to western blotting after they were treated with alkaline-phosphatase in the presence or absence of phosphatase inhibitors as indicated. A 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel was used in this experiment.


3658 T. Kishi and F. Yamao 4). Only higher molecular mass forms of Cln2-HA were associated with Gst-Grr1 (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 1 and 5). The higher molecular mass forms were due to hyperphosphorylation of Cln2-HA, since they were converted to faster migrating moieties after alkaline phosphatase treatment (Fig. 2B, lanes 1-3). These results are consistent with a previous in vitro study (Skowyra et al., 1997). Next, we examined whether Cln2 associates with Grr1-dF or Grr1-dL in vivo. Gst-Grr1-dF was able to bind phosphorylated Cln2-HA as efficiently as Gst-Grr1 (Fig. 2A, lane 2). In contrast, Gst-Grr1-dL drastically decreased its interaction with Cln2-HA (Fig. 2A, lane 3). An almost equal amount of Cln2-HA existed in the preparations (Fig. 2A, lanes 5-8). Gst-Grr1-dL was not totally inactivated since it still retained the ability to bind Skp1 (see next section). These data suggest that the LRR serves as a domain for phosphorylated Cln2 binding, and that the F-box is not required for the association in vivo. Grr1-Skp1 association requires the F-box but not leucine-rich repeats The F-box of Cdc4 was shown to be necessary for Skp1 binding (Bai et al., 1996). Grr1 lacking the F-box does not associate with Skp1 (Kishi et al., 1998; Li and Johnston, 1997), suggesting that the F-box of Grr1 is also responsible for Skp1 binding. On the other hand, the function of the LRR for Grr1Skp1 interaction remains unclear. It has been shown that Grr1 lacking all the 12 tandem repeats of LRR fails to bind Skp1 in vivo (Li and Johnston, 1997). Here, we analyzed whether Skp1 binds Grr1-dL, lacking half of the 12 repeats of the LRR motif. Extracts were prepared from cells producing Arg-Gly-Ser-

(His)6-tagged Skp1 (RGSHis6-Skp1) together with Gst-Grr1 or with its derivatives. Gst-Grr1 copurified with RGSHis6-Skp1 whereas Gst alone did not (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 4). Gst-Grr1-dL copurified with RGSHis6-Skp1 as effectively as Gst-Grr1 did (Fig. 3, lane 3). On the other hand, Gst-Grr1-dF did not allow co-purification of RGSHis6-Skp1 (Fig. 3, lane 2). An equivalent level of RGSHis6-Skp1 was detected in each lysate (Fig. 3, lanes 5-8). These data suggest that the association of Grr1 with Skp1 is dependent on the F-box in vivo. Another point which they suggest is that half of the LRR motif is not required for Skp1 binding, while the region is essential for association with Cln2 (as shown in Fig. 2A).

Since the antibody against Gst did not consistently detect Gst-Grr1, Gst-Grr1dF and Gst-Grr1-dL in lysates, the panel was omitted.

Skp1 associated with phosphorylated Cln2 in a Grr1-dependent manner in vivo Grr1 contains different binding sites for Skp1 and phophorylated Cln2, suggesting that Grr1 acts as a binding core of Skp1 and Cln2. To test this possibility, lysates from cells that produce Gst-Skp1, FLAG epitope-tagged Grr1 (Grr1Flag) and Cln2-HA were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose beads. Phosphorylated Cln2-HA was detected as a protein associated with Gst-Skp1 (Fig. 4A, lane 1). On the other hand, phosphorylated Cln2-HA was not co-precipitated with GstSkp1 when Grr1-Flag was not produced (Fig. 4A, lane 2). As a control, Cln2-HA was not detected when Gst was produced instead of Gst-Skp1 (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4). These demonstrate that Skp1 associates with phosphorylated Cln2 in a Grr1-dependent manner in vivo. We next examined a dependence of Grr1-Cln2 interaction on Skp1 in vivo. To this end, YC111G-RGSHis6-SKP1, pYES2GST-GRR1, YC22G-CLN2-HA and their control vectors were transformed into yeast in the combinations indicated in Fig. 4B. Cell extracts were prepared, and the amount of Cln2-HA co-precipitated with Gst-Grr1 in the presence of RGSHis6Skp1 was compared with that in the absence of RGSHis6-Skp1 (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2). The amount of Cln2-HA associated with Gst-Grr1 was enhanced by RGSHis6-Skp1 (Fig. 4B, top panel, lanes 1 and 2). RGSHis6-Skp1 stimulated the association of Cln2-HA with Gst-Grr1 by 4-fold, when normalized the amount of Cln2-HA with that of Gst-Grr1 in the same blot by densitometry. As a control, Cln2-HA and RGSHis6-Skp1 did not associate with Gst (data not shown). These data suggest that Skp1 stimulates the association of Grr1 with Cln2. On the contrary, Cln2 does not stimulate the Grr1-Skp1 interaction in vivo, since the amount of RGSHis6-Skp1 coprecipitated with Gst-Grr1 was found at an almost equivalent level regardless of the presence of Cln2-HA (Fig. 4B, middle panel, lanes 1 and 3). Cln2 is stabilized in grr1-dF or grr1-dL mutants To construct strains with Grr1 defective in its association with Skp1 or Cln2, we transformed grr1::URA3 cells with GRR1dF or GRR1-dL fragments and selected 5-FOA resistant colonies. Both grr1-dF and grr1-dL cells showed coldsensitive growth, slow growth and the morphological defect, all of which are characteristics of grr1 mutants. Using these mutants, we examined whether association of

Grr1 links Cln2 to Skp1 during Cln2 degradation 3659 Grr1 with Skp1 or with Cln2 is essential for the degradation of Cln2. We intended to compare the half-life of Cln2 in wildtype, grr1-dF, grr1-dL, and grr1::LEU2 strains. To this end, we transformed YC22G-CLN2-HA into each strain, and then Cln2 decay was monitored in the mutant cells by promoter shut-off experiments. Cln2-HA showed a half-life of 5-10 minutes in wild-type cells, whereas it was ~20 minutes in the grr1 disruptant (Fig. 5), as reported previously (Barral et al., 1995). We found that Cln2-HA was highly stabilized in grr1dF and in grr1-dL cells (Fig. 5). In both mutants, higher molecular mass forms of Cln2-HA accumulated. These data suggest that association of Grr1 with Skp1 and with Cln2 is essential for the degradation of Cln2.

DISCUSSION SCF complexes, composed of Skp1, Cdc53 and one of the Fbox proteins, have been suggested to function as E3 ubiquitin ligases in the Cdc34-dependent ubiquitin-conjugation pathway (Feldman et al., 1997; Patton et al., 1998; Skowyra et al., 1997). In this complex, Skp1 serves as a bridge between Cdc53 and F-box proteins. Cdc34, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, interacts with SCF through Cdc53. Substrates are recognized by F-box proteins. The F-box proteins confer specificity to SCF complexes. Cdc4, an F-box protein, is essential for cell cycle progression, and is required for the ubiquitination of several cell cycle regulators including Sic1 (Feldman et al., 1997; Schwob et al., 1994; Skowyra et al., 1997; Verma et al., 1997b), Cdc6 (Drury et al., 1997; Piatti et al., 1996) and Far1 (Henchoz et al., 1997). Cdc4 contains another distinct sequence motif, WD40 repeats. The F-box motif confers the interaction domain for Skp1 (Bai et al., 1996) while WD40 repeats for Sic1 (Feldman et al., 1997; Skowyra et al., 1997). Thus, Cdc4 brings together Sic1 and Skp1 in SCFCdc4. SCFCdc4 has been shown in vitro to mediate ubiquitination of Sic1 (Feldman et al., 1997; Skowyra et al., 1997). Grr1, another F-box protein, is involved in not only regulation of glucose repression (Flick and Johnston, 1991), but also degradation of G1 cyclins Cln1 and Cln2 (Barral et al., 1995). Grr1 contains two distinct motifs, the F-box and the LRR. The F-box of Grr1 is essential for its binding to Skp1 (Kishi et al., 1998; Li and Johnston, 1997), which is similar to that of Cdc4. Grr1 directly interacts in vitro with

Fig. 5. Cln2 decay was monitored in the indicated strains carrying YC22G-CLN2-HA by repression of the GAL1 promoter. Cln2-HA was detected by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. Exposures were adjusted to give approximately equal Cln2-HA signals at the 0 minute time point. Cln2-HA was quantified by densitometry and normalized with Cdc28 signals from the same blot probed with anti-PSTAIRE antibody. Values are shown as a percentage of the signal at 0 minute time point.


3660 T. Kishi and F. Yamao phosphorylated Cln1 and Cln2 (Skowyra et al., 1997), as does Cdc4 with phosphorylated Sic1. However, the significance of the Cln-Grr1 interaction remains obscure, since in vitro ubiquitination of Cln1 by reconstitution of SCFGrr1 has been unsuccessful. The domain of Grr1 responsible for Cln1 and Cln2 binding has not yet been determined. Although LRR of Grr1 could be inferred to be required for the interaction with Cln1 and Cln2, removal of the total LRR destroys the interaction of Grr1 with Skp1 (Li and Johnston, 1997). The present study was conducted to solve these problems. We compared the binding ability of Grr1 and that of its deletion derivatives to Cln2 or to Skp1. Grr1-dL, lacking half of the LRR sequence, interacted with Skp1 in vivo while it did not with Cln2. On the other hand, Grr1-dF, lacking the F-box motif, still retained its ability to bind Cln2 but lost binding to Skp1. Thus, we showed that LRR serves as a domain for Cln2 binding, and that the two domains in Grr1 were functionally separable. We next showed that phosphorylated Cln2 associated with Skp1 in a Grr1-dependent manner in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Cln2 is stabilized and accumulated in phosphorylated forms in cells carrying a grr1 mutation of grr1-dF or grr1-dL. These results indicate that Grr1 is involved in degradation of Cln2 by linking phosphorylated Cln2 to Skp1 in the SCFGrr1 complex. Some F-box proteins contain LRR. For example, human p45SKP2 (Lisztwan et al., 1998), Arabidopsis TIR1 (Ruegger et al., 1998) and COI1 (Xie et al., 1998) have both F-box and LRR, as is also the case with Grr1. p45SKP2 associates with p45SKP1, a human homologue of yeast Skp1, as well as with cyclin A/Cdk2 (Zhang et al., 1995). The deletion of six amino acid residues within the F-box of p45SKP2 is defective in p45SKP1 binding (Lisztwan et al., 1998). The deletion of LRR of p45SKP2 is also defective in cyclin A/Cdk2 (Lisztwan et al., 1998), suggesting that LRR of p45SKP2 contains sequences required for the p45SKP2-cyclin A/Cdk2 complex. The amino acid residues in LRR responsible for cyclin A/Cdk2 interaction are of a KTL (Lys-Thr-Leu) sequence which is located within the last leucinerich repeat of p45SKP2 (Lisztwan et al., 1998). The KTL sequence is similar to the RxL (Arg-X-Leu) motif, which has been implicated as a cyclin-Cdk recognition determinant (Vlach et al., 1997). The RxL motif is also found in LRR of Grr1. However, whether this motif is responsible for the phosphorylationdependent binding of Cln2 remains to be solved. The F-box is implicated in the Skp1 binding motif (Bai et al., 1996). LRR may also be required for the Grr1-Skp1 interaction, since Grr1 lacking total LRR loses its interaction with Skp1 (Li and Johnston, 1997). In this study, we showed that half of the LRR is dispensable for the interaction in vivo. This suggests that the F-box is primarily required for the Grr1Skp1 interaction, which may be partly influenced by the LRR domain. The involvement of LRR in the Grr1-Skp1 interaction may be similar to that of the WD40 repeats of another F-box protein, Met30, in the Met30-Skp1 interaction; the WD-40 repeats of Met30 are dispensable for Skp1 binding but are required for its maximal interaction with Skp1 in vivo (Patton et al., 1998). An alternative explanation for the involvement of LRR in the Grr1-Skp1 interaction is that the association of Cln2 with Grr1 via LRR may be a prerequisite to the subsequent interaction between Grr1 and Skp1. This, however, is unlikely since Cln2 did not stimulate the Grr1-Skp1 interaction in vivo (see next section).

Based on the observation that the Cdc4-Sic1 interaction is enhanced by Skp1 in vitro, it has been discussed that Cdc4 free of Skp1 is prevented from interacting with Sic1 in competition with SCFCdc4 (Feldman et al., 1997; Skowyra et al., 1997). In this report, we found that association of Skp1 with Grr1 stimulates the Grr1-Cln2 binding in vivo. Thus, in addition to tethering Cdc53 and F-box proteins in SCF complexes, Skp1 also plays a role in enhancing F-box protein-substrate interaction, although Skp1 did not bind directly with the substrates. The molecular mechanism that enhances the Grr1Cln2 interaction by Skp1 is unclear. Interestingly, the enhancement is not observed in vitro (Skowyra et al., 1997), suggesting that modification(s) or some other factor(s) contributes to the interaction among Skp1, Grr1 and Cln2. The fact that yeast Skp1 stimulates the F-box protein-substrate interactions suggests that yeast SCF complexes recognize substrates directly. Conversely, however, in the case of the human p19SKP1-p45SKP2-cyclin A/Cdk2 complex, p45SKP2p19SKP1 binding is dependent on p45SKP2-cyclin A/Cdk2 complex formation (Lisztwan et al., 1998).
