Two-hybrid interaction of a human UBC9 homolog with centromere proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae

Received: 27 July 1995 / Accepted: 29 November 1995

Abstract Using a two-hybrid system, we cloned a human cDNA encoding a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC), hºBC9, which interacts specifically with all three subunits of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae centromere DNA-binding core complex, CBF3. The hUBC9 protein shows highest homology to a new member of the UBC family: 54% identity to S. cerevisiae Ubc9p and 64% identity to Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Sp) hus5. Overexpression of hUBC9 partially suppresses a S. cerevisiae ubc9 temperature-sensitive mutation, indicating that the ºBC9 gene family is also functionally conserved. Like hUBC9, Sphus5 also interacts specifically with all three subunits of the CBF3 complex. However, S. cerevisiae Ubc9p interacts only with the Cbf3p subunit (64 kDa) of the CBF3 complex, indicating the specificity of the interaction between S. cerevisiae Ubc9 and Cbf3p proteins. The function of Ubc9p in the G/M phase of S. cerevisiae could be related to regulation of centromere proteins in chromosome segregation in mitosis. Therefore, the ubiquitination process and centromere function may be linked to chromosome segregation. We also provide further in vivo evidence that Mck1p, a protein kinase, is specifically associated with the centromere proteins Cbf2p and Cbf5p, which were previously shown to interact in vitro.

Introduction Centromeres play an important role in proper chromosome segregation during eukaryotic cell divisions. In Communicated by C. P. Hollenberg W. Jiang ( ) · Y. Koltin Myco Pharmaceuticals Inc., One Kendall Square, Building 300, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA

higher eukaryotes, the centromere contains a kinetochore, which is a multilayered protein complex that provides an attachment site for spindle microtubules. The kinetochore also keeps sister chromatids attached before anaphase and moves the chromosome along the microtubules during prometaphase and anaphase. The same functions are also performed by the centromere of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, although its centromere is by far the simplest known in eukaryotic organisms. The centromere DNA of S. cerevisiae consists of 125 bp (Cottarel et al. 1989; reviewed in Carbon and Clarke 1990; Clarke 1990), including two highly conserved protein binding sites (the 8-bp CDEI and the 25-bp CDEIII) flanking a 78 to 86-bp (A#T)-rich central sequence (CDEII). Proteins that bind specifically to both the CDEI and CDEIII sequences have been purified (CEP1/CBF1/CPF1: Baker et al. 1989; Cai and Davis 1989; Jiang and Philipssen 1989; CBF3: Lechner and Carbon 1991). Genes encoding these proteins have also been cloned. CPF1, encoding a helix-loop-helix protein with a function in methionine prototrophy (Baker and Masison 1990; Cai and Davis 1990; Mellor et al. 1990), is dispensable for cell growth, although centromere functions are altered if it is deleted. Genes encoding the three major subunits (CBF3A, 3B, 3C) of the CDEIII-binding protein complex, CBF3, were also recently cloned. CBF2/NDC10, encoding the 110-kDa CBF3A subunit, was cloned by Jiang et al. (1993a), using oligonucleotides deduced from tryptic peptide sequences of the purified protein, and by Goh and Kilmartin (1993) following screening of temperaturesensitive mutants for abnormal spindle structure using anti-tubulin antibody. Cbf2p was immunolocalized at the spindle pole body and along the mitotic spindle (Goh and Kilmartin 1993; Jiang and Carbon 1993). CBF3/CEP3, encoding the 64-kDa CBF3B subunit, was cloned by Lechner (1994) based on tryptic peptide sequences of CBF3B and by Strunnikov et al. (1995) by genetic screening based on the generation of ``synthetic


154 acentric'' minichromosomes. C¹F13, encoding the 58kDa CBF3C subunit, was cloned by Doheny et al. (1993) by screening for relaxation of a transcription block formed at centromeres and an increase in the mitotic stability of a dicentric test chromosome. All three genes are essential for cell growth, while CDEIII DNA is also an essential component for chromosome segregation. Two other centromere-associated proteins, Cbf5p and Top2p, were identified by low-stringency CEN DNA-affinity chromatography (Jiang et al. 1993b). CBF5 encodes a nucleolar protein that binds microtubules in vitro and is also essential for cell growth (Jiang et al. 1993b; unpublished data). Genetic data suggest that Cbf5p interacts with Cbf2p, since overexpression of CBF5 suppresses mutations in CBF2 (Jiang et al. 1995). MCK1, encoding a protein kinase, was previously shown to be a multicopy suppressor of a specific CDEIII DNA mutation (Shero and Hieter 1991) and mutations in both cbf2 and cbf5 mutations (Jiang et al. 1995). Mck1p can phosphorylate Cbf2p at serine and threonine residues in vitro (Jiang et al. 1995). Recently, an additional putative centromere protein gene, CSE4, was isolated by Stoler et al. (1995). The cse4-4 mutant exhibits an increase in the frequency of non-disjunction of a marked chromosome at permissive temperatures and arrests in mitosis at non-permissive temperatures. CSE4 encodes an essential protein that is remarkably similar in structure to the human CENP-A. They both contain a histone H3-like domain. Further evidence is required to show that its function is involved in the assembly of centromeric chromatin. To identify proteins that interact with the centromere core complex, we used the two-hybrid system (Chien et al. 1991). Using Cbf2p as bait, we cloned a human gene encoding a ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) enzyme. We were able to show sequence homology between this human ºBC gene and a recently discovered yeast ºBC9 gene. By showing that hUBC9 complements a temperature-sensitive S. cerevisiae ubc9-1 mutation, we demonstrated that the human ºBC9 gene is also a functional homolog of the yeast ºBC9 gene. We also found that Mck1p interacts in vivo with Cbf2p and Cbf5p, as was previously shown in in vitro experiments. These results may indicate that the MCK1 kinase regulates centromere functions in S. cerevisiae through phosphorylation of specific polypeptides.

Two-hybrid system and plasmid construction The Clontech MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system was applied in this study (for a full description of the system, see the manufacturer's instruction book). Table 1 lists all plasmids used in this two-hybrid test. Plasmid pGBT9 contains a GAL4(1-147) DNA-binding domain, for the fusion constructs, under control of the ADH1 promoter, together with the ¹RP1 marker and a 2- m origin of replication. pGAD424 is a 2- m/LEU2 plasmid containing the GAL4 (768--881) activation domain under the same ADH1 promoter as in pGBT9. Both vectors were used in most of the plasmid constructions in this study. A human HeLa S3 MATCHMAKER cDNA library based on vector pGAD-GH [LEU2, GAL4 (768--881) fusion] was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, Calif.). pDTB11, obtained from D. Brazill (University of California at Berkeley, Calif.), contains a GAL4(1-147)-MCK1 fusion, in which the NdeI-BamHI fragment from plasmid YEp[MCK1] (Lim et al. 1993) was subcloned into the same sites of pAS1-CYH2 (with the ¹RP1 marker). pACT#hus5 was obtained from T. Carr (Sussex University, Brighton, UK). It contains the S. pombe gene hus5 fused to GAL4(1-147) in plasmid pACT2 (with the ¸Eº2 marker). The S. cerevisiae CBF2 gene containing the whole open reading frame (ORF) was amplified from pWJ316-110B (Jiang et al. 1993a) by PCR using primers CBF2N (CGGGATCCATATGAGATCATCG, with the BamHI linker underlined) and CBF2C (GCGAGCTCATAGTAAACATC, with the SacI linker underlined) and subcloned into pUC19, resulting in pWJ110BS. A BamHI-PvuII fragment from pWJ110BS was further subcloned into the BamHI and PstI sites of pGBT9 in which the PstI site had been blunted with T4 DNA polymerase, resulting in plasmid pGBT9#CBF2. The same fragment was also subcloned into the BamHI and BglII sites of pGAD424 in which the BglII site was blunted with Klenow enzyme and four deoxynucleotide triphosphates, resulting in plasmid pGAD#CBF2. The C¹F13 gene, containing the whole ORF, was amplified from pKF11 (Doheny et al. 1993; provided by P. Heiter)

GCCTTCTTTCAATCCTGTT, with the EcoRI-NdeI linker underlined) and CTF13C (5-GGGGTACCGCCGGTTTTCCAC, with the KpnI linker underlined), and was subcloned into the EcoRI and KpnI sites of pUC19, resulting in pWJ58RK. The EcoRI-XbaI fragment of pWJ58RK was further subcloned into the same sites of pYES2 (In Vitrogen, San Diego, Calif), resulting in pWJ2#58. A PstI EcoRI fragment of pWJ58RK, with the EcoRI site blunted with Klenow and deoxynucleotide triphosphates, was subcloned into the SmaI and PstI sites of pGAD424, resulting in plasmid pGAD#CTF13. The CBF3 gene, containing the whole ORF, was amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA by PCR using primers CBF3N (5-CGGAATTCCATATGTTTAACCGTACCACTCAAC, with the EcoRI linker underlined) and CBF3C (5CGGGATCCTTAGGAAAGTATGTCAGAAATG, with the BamHI linker underlined), and was subcloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of plasmids pGBT9 and pGAD424, resulting in plasmids pGBT9#CBF3 and pGAD#CBF3, respectively. A PstI fragment of the CBF5 gene from plasmid pWJ64PCR (Jiang et al. 1993b) was subcloned into the PstI site of pGAD424, resulting in pGAD#CBF5. The S. cerevisiae ºBC9 gene containing the whole ORF was amplified by PCR using primers UBC9N (5-CGGAATTCATGAGTAGTTTGTGTCTACAG, with the EcoRI linker underlined) and UBC9C (5-CAGGATCCTTTAGAGTACTGTTTAGCTTG, with the BamHI linker underlined), and subcloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of plasmids pGBT9 and pGAD424, resulting in plasmids pGBT9#UBC9 and pGAD#UBC9, respectively. All fusion sites were verified by sequencing.

Isolation of genes encoding proteins interacting with Cbf 2p The yeast strain HF7c, containing the plasmid pGBT9#CBF2 expressing the GAL4(1-147)-CBF2 fusion under the control of the ADH1 promoter, was transformed with MATCHMAKER libraries (Clontech) using the lithium acetate high-efficiency method (Gietz et al. 1992). pGBT9#CBF2/HF7c cells were grown initially in SD!Trp medium and then in YPD for an additional hour before transformation. One-tenth of the transformed sample was plated on selective medium without leucine and tryptophan to calculate total transformants. The rest of the transformants were plated directly on the selective medium without leucine, tryptophan, and histidine. A human HeLa S3 cDNA library was used to transform pGBT9#CBF2/HF7c cells. Positive clones from SD-Trp-Leu-His were further tested for -galactosidase activity by filter assay (Clontech, Calif.). Plasmid DNA was rescued in Escherichia coli DH5 from yeast cells which were cured of plasmid pGBT9#CBF2. Plasmids were retransformed into yeast HF7c cells with plasmid pGBT9#CBF2 to test for histidine prototrophy and -galactosidase activity. Insert DNA was sequenced with a Sequenase kit (Amersham) by primer walking. Sequence homologies were searched by the BLAST program.

Overexpression of human ºBC9 in S. cerevisiae Human (h) ºBC9 cDNA from one of the largest clones was digested with EcoRI and XbaI and subcloned into the same sites of the yeast expression vectors YCpIF4 (ºRA3, CEN4, ARS1) and YCpIF7 (HIS3, CEN4, ARS1) (Foreman and Davis 1994), resulting in YCpIF4#hUBC9 and YCpIF7#hUBC9, respectively. YCpIF4 and YCpIF4#hUBC9 were transformed into the ubc9-1 mutant strains YWO102a and YWO100. YCpIF7 and YCpIF7#hUBC9 were transformed into YWO102 and a plasmid-bearing, wild-type UBC9containing yeast strain, YWO90, in which the genomic copy had been deleted. Functions of these plasmids were tested either by a temperature sensitivity test or by a plasmid shuffling test to see whether these plasmids could replace the original ºBC9-containing plasmid.

Results Identification of Cbf2p-interacting proteins by the two-hybrid system To identify proteins that interact with the yeast centromere complex, we used the two-hybrid system to detect protein--protein interactions (Chien et al. 1991; Fields and Song 1989). We chose CBF2p as a bait for this study, since Cbf2p is the largest essential subunit of the yeast centromere-binding complex CBF3, and the gene encoding Cbf2p is one of the best studied of the yeast centromere protein genes. We first tested the interaction between Cbf2p and a serine/theronine protein kinase, Mck1p, in the twohybrid system, since it has been demonstrated that Cbf2p can be phosphorylated by Mck1p in vitro and that overexpression of MCK1 suppresses cbf2 ts mutations (Jiang et al. 1995). A full-length ORF of CBF2 was fused into both hybrid vectors (pGBT9 and pGAD424), resulting in plasmids pGBT9#CBF2 and pGAD# CBF2, respectively. MCK1 was fused with GAL4(1--147) in plasmid pAS1-CYH2, resulting in plasmid pDTB11. Functional expression of pGAD#CBF2 was verified by complementation of cbf2 ts mutants (data not shown). The two hybrid plasmids were cotransformed into a two-hybrid tester strain, HF7c, in which the expression of both lacZ and HIS3 reporter genes was placed under the control of the GAL4 binding site. Transformants were tested on selective media without leucine and tryptophan or without leucine, tryptophan, and histidine. Cells cotransformed with pDTB11 and pGAD#CBF2 grew on both media, while controls such as pDTB11 and pGAD424 or pGBT9 and pGAD#CBF2 grew only on selective medium without leucine and tryptophan, but not on a medium devoid of leucine, tryptophan, and histidine. -Galactosidase activity in the transformants was tested on filters. Cotransformants of pDTB11 and pGAD#CBF2 turned blue while none of the controls did (data not shown). These results indicate that Mck1p interacts with CBF2p in vivo. These results provide further evidence that Mck1p may play an important role in centromere function by phosphorylation of Cbf2p in vivo. The results also suggest that GAL4-CBF2 fusion proteins can be used for detection of specific interactions with other proteins. We obtained similar results using the twohybrid system to test the interaction of Mck1p and Cbf5p (data not shown). Cloning of a Cbf2p-interacting protein gene from a human cDNA library To clone genes whose products interact with centromere proteins, we used the GAL4(1--147)-CBF2 fusion (plasmid pGBT9#CBF2) as bait to screen a human cDNA library based on the two-hybrid vector


156 pGAD-GH. About 10 transformants were tested, and ten positive clones were obtained. Four of these clones were also shown to be positive in the -galactosidase filter assay. Library plasmids from these four transformants were rescued in E. coli after curing the cells from plasmid pGBT9#CBF2 on nonselective medium. Both the His> phenotype and the expression of galactosidase were confirmed by a second-round transformation of strain HF7c carrying pGBT9#CBF2.

Human UBC9 protein specifically interacts with yeast centromere proteins Plasmids from these four positive clones were first analyzed by restriction digestion. Two were shown to Fig. 1 DNA sequence of the hUBC9 cDNA and the predicted protein. The nucleotide and amino acid residues are numbered at the right (Genbank accession number: U31882)

be of identical length and sequence. Two clones of different length were shown to derive from the same gene. One of the largest clones, having an insert of 1.1 kb, was completely sequenced on both strands (Fig. 1). This cDNA clone encodes a 158-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular weight of 17.9 kDa. A homology search in the database using the BLAST program showed that this is a new sequence, previously unidentified, and is homologous to a known family of UBCs. It has highest homology to a new member of this enzyme family: S. cerevisiae Ubc9p (54% identical; Seufert et al. 1995) and S. pombe hus5 (64% identical; Al-Khodairy et al. 1995) (Fig. 2). It also contains a conserved, putative active-site cysteine residue, in common with all ºBC genes. Substitution of this conserved cysteine residue by a serine residue

resulted in a complete loss of UBC9 function in vivo (Seufert et al. 1995).

Overexpression of human UBC9 complements the ts mutation ubc9-1 in S. cerevisiae To determine whether human (h) ºBC9 is a true functional homolog of the yeast ºBC9 gene, we tested the hºBC9 gene function in S. cerevisiae. We subcloned hºBC9 into vectors containing a GA¸1-controlled promoter, YcpIF4 (ºRA3, CEN4, ARS1) and YCpIF7 (HIS3, CEN4, ARS1) (Foreman and Davis 1994), resulting in plasmids YCpIF4#hUBC9 and YCpIF7# hUBC9, respectively. Plasmid YCpIF4#hUBC9 was transformed into another ubc9-1ts mutant strain, YWO102. Transformants were replica-plated from SDUra onto SGal-Ura and incubated at 37° C. Figure 3 shows that hºBC9 can partially suppress the S. cerevisiae ubc9-1ts phenotype. Similar results were also obtained by plasmid shuffling when YCpIF4#hUBC9 was transformed into the YWO100 strain (ubc9- 1 : : ¹RP1, ubc9-1ts on a HIS3-containing plasmid) (data not shown). However, we were unable to cure the original plasmid containing the S. cerevisiae (Sc) ºBC9 gene from YCpIF7#hUBC9/YWO100 transformants by replica-plating single colonies after nonselective growth on SGal-Ura or YPGal medium onto SGal-His medium. To verify this result we used another yeast strain, YWO90, which contains a wild-type ScºBC9 gene on a ºRA3 vector.

157 YCpIF7#hUBC9 transformants were grown on SGalHis medium and replica-plated onto a complete SGal medium with 5-fluoorotic acid. None of the transformants grew, indicating that the hºBC9 gene cannot replace the S. cerevisiae gene in the ubc9 null background. Therefore, it appears that the hUBC9 protein is only partially functional in S. cerevisiae, which may be explained simply by sequence differences of the protein in these two organisms.

hUBC9 protein interacts with other centromere proteins and itself To test the specificity of the hUBC9 interaction with other centromere proteins, we constructed fusions of other centromere proteins in two-hybrid vectors (see Table 1 and Materials and methods). Cotransformants growing on SD-Leu-Trp medium were further tested for the His> phenotype and the -galactosidase activity in the filter assay. Results of the prototrophy tests, which are summarized in Table 2, were always compatible with those of the -galactosidase filter assay. hUBC9 interacts not only with Cbf2p, but also with two other major components of the centromere DNAbinding complex, Cbf3p and Ctf13p. No interactions with hUBC9 were detectable when the vector alone was used or the vector in which a CBF5 fusion was used. The fission yeast homolog, S. pombe (Sp) hus5, of the S. cerevisiae Ubc9p is also able to interact with Cbf2p in the two-hybrid test. Interestingly, hUBC9 can interact with itself and the Sphus5 protein in the two-hybrid test (see Table 2), implying that hUBC9 may be autoubiquitinated like some other UBCs (Goebl et al. 1994; Pitluk et al. 1995). Our tests indicate that the Sphus5 fusion protein also interacts with Cbf2p in this twohybrid test. These results provide additional evidence showing that the fission yeast Ubc9p is also a functional homolog of the hUBC9 protein. Interactions between Cbf2p, Cbf3p, and Ctf13p were undetectable in both His> and -galactosidase assays, although in earlier studies these three proteins always copurified when eluted from a centromere DNA column and other chromatographic media. We have previously provided evidence that Cbf2p may oligomerize (Jiang and Carbon 1993). However, we were unable to show the in vivo interaction between Cbf2p itself in the two-hybrid system. The failure to detect in vivo interactions may be due to the limitations of the two-hybrid

S. cerevisiae Ubc9p interacts with the Cbf3p subunit of the CBF3 complex To verify the interaction of the CBF3 complex with S. cerevisiae Ubc9p, we tested the interaction of S. cerevisiae Ubc9p with all three subunits of the CBF3 complex. Interestingly, the two-hybrid test of the Cbf3p subunit of the CBF3 complex and S. cerevisiae Ubc9p showed positive results from both the -galactosidase filter assay and histidine selection, while no interaction between Cbf2p and Ubc9p or Ctf13p and Ubc9p was detectable (Table 2). Therefore, in S. cerevisiae itself, Ubc9p only interacts with the Cbf3p subunit of the complex. Since Cbf2p, Cbf3p, and Ctf13p are three essential components of the CDEIII DNA-binding protein complex, the interaction of hUBC9 or Sphus5 with the Cbf2p and Ctf13 subunits may be caused by the strong interaction of Cbf3p with the Cbf2p subunit through CBF3 complex formation. However, we cannot exclude a possibly direct interaction of hUBC9 or Sphus5 with the Cbf2p and Ctf13p subunits in a less specific manner.

Cbf3p interacts with itself Cbf3p is one of the core subunits constituting the CDEIII DNA-binding complex. It contains an Nterminal ZnCys-type zinc finger domain and a Cterminal putative coiled-coil dimerization domain (Lechner 1994; Strunnikov et al. 1995). We tested the dimerization function of Cbf3p in the two-hybrid system. Cbf3p was fused to both the GAL4-DNA binding domain (resulting in pGBT9#CBF3) and the activation domain (resulting in pGAD#CBF3) (also see Table 1). Cotransformants exhibit both the His> phenotype and -galactosidase activity (data not shown), indicating that Cbf3p is able to interact in vivo with itself. This interaction is most likely to involve Cbf3p dimerization, as predicted from its putative coiled-coil domain (Lechner 1994).

Discussion We have isolated a human ºBC9 gene on the basis of the ability of this gene product to associate in vivo with the yeast centromere protein Cbf2p, using the twohybrid system (Chien et al. 1991; Fields and Song 1989). All three genes encoding three subunits of the S. cerevisiae centromere CDEIII DNA-binding core complex are essential for centromere function and cell viability (Doheny et al. 1993; Goh and Kilmartin 1993; Jiang et al. 1993a; Lechner 1994; Strunnikov et al.

1995). Cells bearing a conditional mutation in CBF2/ NDC10 show a pronounced defect in chromosome segregation. The chromosomes remain at one pole of the anaphase spindle at non-permissive temperatures. Depletion of Cbf2p results in aneuploid cells without specific cell cycle arrest because of chromosome missegregation. In the cases of CBF2 and C¹F13, temperature-sensitive mutations or protein depletion cause cell cycle arrest at the G/M phase, indicating that both proteins are essential for cells to enter or complete mitosis (Doheny et al. 1993; Lechner 1994; Strunnikov et al. 1995). Recently, Seufert et al. (1995) identified a new essential nuclear UBC, UBC9, and found that repression of UBC9 synthesis prevents cell cycle progression at the G or early M phase, causing the accumulation of large budded cells with a single nucleus, a short spindle, and duplicated DNA. A S. pombe homolog of UBC9, hus5>, was also recently reported (Al-Khodairy et al. 1995). hus5 deletion mutants are severely impaired in growth and exhibit high levels of abortive mitoses, suggesting a role for hus5> in chromosome segregation. From the present study, we provide evidence that UBC9 may regulate centromere protein functions. Firstly, the hUBC9 protein interacts specifically in vivo with all three centromere core proteins in the two-hybrid test. No interaction with Cbf5p or the controls was found. Secondly, Ubc9p homologs from both S. pombe and human cells can interact with centromere proteins, and the human UBC9 homolog partially complements a temperature-sensitive yeast ubc9 mutation, indicating conservation of the function of the UBC9 protein. Thirdly, S. cerevisiae Ubc9p interacts specifically with the Cbf3p subunit of the CBF3 centromere protein complex, not with the other two subunits. Ubc9p has been shown to be involved in B-type cyclin degradation in yeast (Seufert et al. 1995). However, no specific relevant substrates have been found to have similar functions in G/M phase. Recently, Holloway et al. (1993) showed that methylated ubiquitin, which inhibits ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, delays sister chromatid separation in the Xenopus egg system. This suggests that ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis is necessary to initiate anaphase. They also showed that an N-terminal cyclin fragment inhibits chromosome separation, even in extracts that contain only non-degradable forms of cyclins, suggesting that proteins other than the known cyclins must be degraded to dissolve the linkage between sister chromatids. Our present study in S. cerevisiae suggests that the ubiquitination of centromere proteins could play an important role in the regulation of mitosis. Since the Cbf3p subunit of the centromere protein complex has the DNA-binding domain, the posttranslational regulation of this protein might control sister chromatid segregation. Recently, Yoon and Carbon (1995) reported that overexpression of the yeast CDC34 gene encoding another UBC, Ubc3p/Cdc34p, specifically suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth


phenotype of a ndc10/cbf2 mutant. Both in vivo and in vitro data suggest that Cbf2p is an endogenous substrate of Cdc34p. It also implies that Cdc34p may play a regulatory role in kinetochore function through the ubiquitination of Cbf2p, although mutations in CDC34 arrest yeast cells in the G phase of the cell cycle. Since depletion of Ubc9p causes cell cycle arrest at the G/M phase (Seufert et al. 1995), it might play a more relevant role in the regulation of kinetochore function in mitosis. From the two-hybrid test, we were unable to show interactions among the three core subunits, Cbf3p, Cbf2p, and Ctf13p, of the CDEIII DNA-binding complex. This might reflect the limitations of this test, or additional factors may be needed for the assembly of the core complex. Moreover, we were able to show that Cbf3p interacts with itself, which provides in vivo evidence that Cbf3p may form a dimer, as predicted from the putative coiled-coil domain of Cbf3p (Lechner 1994). The zinc finger domain of Cbf3p is similar to a known DNA-binding domain in Gal4p. Gal4p contacts only a highly conserved CCG triplet at each end of the Gal4p binding site, as revealed by X-ray crystallography data (Marmorstein et al. 1992). A single CCG triplet in the CDEIII region of CEN DNA, which is unlike the Gal4p binding site (a pair of the triplet), may allow only one Cbf3p to bind, but it might be possible for Cbf3p to dimerize with the molecule that binds to the triplet on the sister chromatid. Using the two-hybrid system, we have not only cloned a new gene, ºBC9, encoding a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that interacts with centromere proteins, but we have also provided in vivo support for the previous result that Cbf2p could be phosphorylated by Mck1p in vitro. Therefore, phosphorylation and ubiquitination are most likely to be involved in the regulation of centromere protein functions. Further studies of centromere proteins with the two-hybrid system may reveal additional information concerning centromere function and regulation of centromere protein functions.
