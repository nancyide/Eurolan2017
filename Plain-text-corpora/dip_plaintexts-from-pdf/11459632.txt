Abstract The interaction trap method was used to isolate putative binding partners of Rad16/Pso5, a protein responsible for repair of silent DNA. One of the interactors found was Sgs1, a DNA helicase influencing the life span of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with homology to the human BLM, WRN and RECQL4 proteins. Using the same fusion proteins from the two-hybrid screening, we show evidence that both proteins also interact in vitro. We tested isogenic strains, containing mutant alleles of the two genes in single and double mutant combination, for phenotypic similarity. Life span in sgs1 single and sgs1 rad16 double mutants is about 40% of that of WT, and the rad16/pso5 single mutant also had its life span reduced to 75%. Sensitivity to different mutagens, whose lesions are poorly repaired in rad16/pso5 mutants, was tested in sgs1 mutants. The sgs1 between rad16 and sgs1 mutations after UVC, 4-NQO and H2O2 was observed. Moreover, we found that in a top3 background, functional Sgs1p and Rad16p apparently channel MMS, 4-NQO and H2O2 induced lesions into aberrant DNA repair. Our results demonstrate that Sgs1 is not only involved in genome stability, somatic recombination and aging, but is also implicated, together with Rad16/Pso5, in the repair of specific DNA damage. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

At stationary phase of growth cells harboring mutant allele pso5-1 are moderately sensitive to UVC and to the UV mimetic 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO). They show cross-sensitivity to photo-

activated 3-carbethoxypsoralen (3-CPS + UVA), a treatment producing either 4 ­5 furan-side pyrimidine monoadducts in DNA or singlet oxygen. The mutation pso5-1 also confers sensitivity to other oxidative stress-enhancing chemicals, such as hydrogen peroxide and paraquat [1­3]. PSO5/RAD16 encodes a 91.3 kD protein (790 amino acids) containing two putative zinc finger domains and several other helicase-typical regions that are also found in several other yeast proteins like Snf2, Rad54 and Mot1 [4,5], Brm (Drosophila), and human Hsnf2, the latter being a homologue of Snf2

[6]. The yeast gene RAD54 is involved in recombinational repair, while all of the other proteins have been implicated in transcriptional regulation. The N-terminal part of Rad16 contains a high number of charged amino acids, a feature also found in yeast repair proteins Rad4, Rad6, and Rad7 and it also contains a signal sequence for nuclear localization [4,5]. Rad16 has been shown to function in a specific subpathway (global genome repair) of nucleotide excision repair (NER), which preferentially repairs pyrimidine dimers of the cyclobutane type (CPDs) in either the HMLa or the HML loci [5], in the silent regions of DNA, and in non-transcribed strands of active genes [4,5,7]. Rad16 interacts physically with Rad7 and this complex binds UV damaged DNA, in an ATP-dependent manner [8­10]. Yeast mutants rad16 and rad7 lack global genome repair, whereas their transcription-coupled repair is not affected [7]. Recent studies have shown that Rad16, together with Rad7 may participate in postincision events during NER [11]. This means, in contrast to a previous suggestion [8], that such mutants cannot efficiently execute the subsequent steps of oligonucleotide excision and repair synthesis. These results, together with the fact that Rad16 is a member of the SWI2/SNF2 superfamily of DNA-dependent ATPase [4], suggest that Rad7­Rad16 complex may facilitate the remodeling of a protein­DNA structure generated by damage specific incision (possibly including the NER machinery) that is uniquely associated with NER of transcriptionally repressed regions and the nontranscribed strand of transcriptionally active genes. This remodeling presumably facilitates oligonucleotide excision and repair synthesis. Additionally, it has been shown that rad7 and rad16 mutants are proficient for NER-dependent incision in regions such as HMLa [10,11]. While it appears safe to postulate a function of RAD16/PSO5 in NER, there remains the question whether Pso5/Rad16 also interacts with proteins, not necessarily involved in DNA repair. Its partner Rad7 (NEF4 component) has been reported to physically interact with Sir3p, which is involved in the structural conformation of certain transcriptionally repressed regions of DNA [12]. In order to find possible binding partners of Pso5 we performed a two hybrid screen [13,14] using the full-length LexA­PSO5 DNA binding domain fusion gene as bait and a genomic S. cerevisiae library.

Amongst different potential interactors we isolated a part of the coding region of the SGS1 gene, which is a slow growth suppressor of topoisomerase 3 (top3) mutants [15], and is also implicated in yeast aging [16], as the strongest interactor of PSO5 bait. In a phenotypic characterization of sgs1 and rad16/pso5 single and double mutant strains after treatments with UVC, 4-NQO, MMS and H2O2 we were able to show that a sgs1 mutant enhanced the cells' sensitivity to some mutagens suggesting that Sgs1 is involved in DNA repair processes in S. cerevisiae. Moreover, we have shown that Top3p, the previously identified interactor of Sgs1p [15], either alone or in conjunction with Rad16p and/or Sgs1p is also implicated in DNA processing lesions. In addition, we have also observed that PSO5/RAD16 gene has some implication in yeast aging.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae The relevant genotypes of strains used in this work are listed in Table 1. RAD16 disrupted and SGS1 disrupted strains, rad16 and sgs1 , were generated in WT W303 [17], by one step gene disruption [18]. The double mutant strain rad16 sgs1 was generated by disruption of the SGS1 WT gene in a rad16 single mutant strain. Isogenic strains containing the top3 mutation (top3 , top3 sgs1 , top3 sgs1 rad16 ) were kindly provided by Sinclair. The double mutant top3 rad16 was obtained by disruption

of the RAD16 WT gene in a top3 2.2. Media and growth conditions strain.

Yeast strains were grown at 30C in YPD liquid medium/plates containing 2% glucose, 1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone or selective medium/plates supplemented with the appropriate nutrients (SD medium is 2% glucose/galactose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, plus nutrients) [19]. 2.3.

plasmid contains the RAD16 gene disrupted with URA3. The plasmid was digested with PvuI. This DNA was used to transform the haploid strain W303 to Ura+ in a one-step gene disruption [18]. Plasmid pDB20, containing 4.3 kb of the SGS1 gene cloned into the NotI site [20], was as gift of Sinclair, and was used for SGS1 disruption. This NotI fragment of SGS1 was subcloned into plasmid pGEM4Z. The plasmid was cleaved with NruI 162 bp downstream of ATG, inside the coding region of SGS1. After SacII digestion 3994 bp were removed and replaced by the LEU2 gene. The resulting plasmid was restricted with SacI/BamHI and the DNA was used to transform haploid strain W303 and rad16 . Disruption of the RAD16 and SGS1 genes, respectively, was verified by southern analysis (not shown) as well as by proving their pleiotropic mutagen sensitivity phenotype and by life span analysis. 2.4. E. coli strain and plasmids E. coli K-12 KC8 pyrF::Tn5, hsdR, leuB600, trpC9830, lacD74, strA, galK, hisB436 was used for the rescue of yeast plasmids as described previously [21]. The plasmid pJG4-5 [14], containing a genomic yeast library carries the B42 activation domain, the influenza virus HA1 epitope tag and the SV40 nuclear localization signal. Brent provided this vector, together with LexA-fusion DNA binding vector pEG202 and the lacZ reporter plasmid pSH18­34. 2.5. Two-hybrid screen 2.5.1. Construction of baits Plasmid pCP482 [1] containing a 5.4 kb insert of PSO5/RAD16 gene was digested with AflII, originating the fragment PSO5/RAD16 (AflII), containing 2.62 kb of the gene. This fragment was subcloned into the SmaI cloning site of plasmid pGEM4Z (Promega, Biotec). To generate the 5 part of the gene a PCR starting at the ATG start codon (containing an EcoRI cloning site) and ending at the RsrII site of PSO5/RAD16 was performed and the product of 244 bp was cloned into pGEM4Z containing PSO5/RAD16 (AflII) digested with EcoRI and RsrII. The resulting plasmid PSO5/RAD16 (ATG­AflII)-full-length was digested with EcoRI and BamHI. The resulting fragment containing the complete open reading frame of the PSO5/RAD16 gene was cloned into plasmid pEG202/EcoRI/BamHI, originating the pEG­PSO5 (ATG) bait, which was also called LexA­Pso5 (aa 1­790). The second bait was also constructed, lacking the first 82 aminoacids from the N-terminal part of Pso5/Rad16 protein. The construct started at the RsrII site of PSO5/RAD16 gene and was cloned into pEG202 digested with EcoRI/BamHI. The resulting plasmid was called pEG­PSO5 (RsrII) or LexA­Pso5 (aa 82­790). The correct orientation and in-frame fusions of PSO5/RAD16 gene with the LexA DNA binding domain were verified by sequencing using a LexA DNA binding domain specific primer (5 -CAG AGC TTC

ACC ATT GAA GGG-3 ). Before starting the screening, two other assays were made with the baits. First, the repression assay [22] to confirm that the LexA fusions proteins are synthesized in yeast and bind to the LexA operators. The expression of LexA­Pso5 (aa 1­790) and LexA­Pso5 (aa 82­790) proteins were also detected by western blot using the polyclonal LexA antibody (Santa Cruz) (data not shown). Second, the baits were transformed into the mutant strain pso5-1 (Table 1) and five transformants were checked for UVC sensitivity in order to check for the complementation of this phenotype. 2.5.2. Two hybrid screen The two-hybrid screen was performed essentially as described previously [14,21]. The plasmid pJG4­5, containing a yeast activation domain library, constructed by Paul Watt [23] was transformed into the reporter strain EGY194, carrying pEG­PSO5 (ATG) and pSH18­34, as described [24]. Plasmids were isolated from yeast that survived selection for leucine prototrophy on galactose and showed lacZ expression on X-gal-glucose plates. 2.5.3. The -galactosidase quantitative assay The quantification of the -galactosidase activity was assayed by a modification of Guarente's method (1983) [25]. Three individual transformants were assayed after growth overnight in liquid SC lacking the appropriate nutrients, utilizing 2% raffinose as a carbon source. The cells were diluted and were grown to mid-log phase in 2% galactose for 4 h. After centrifugation, they were resuspended in 500 l of Z buffer (100 mM NaPO4 at pH 7.0, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM Mg(SO4)2, 38 mM -mercaptoethanol). The OD600 was determined for the washed cells, 25 l of 0.1% SDS was added to cell suspension and mixed vigorously for 15 s, followed by addition of 50 l of chloroform with repeated vortexing. After incubation for 15 min at 30C, 0.2 ml of ONPG (4 mg/ml) stock) was added, and the reaction was incubated at 30C until a yellow color began to appear, or for 15 min after which 0.4 ml of 1.0 M Na2CO3 was added to terminate the reaction. The cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 2.500 rpm and the OD420 and OD550 were determined. Basal -galactosidase activity was measured by grown on glucose liquid cultures. The activity of -galactosidase in Miller units was calculated by use of the formula units = 1000 × [(OD420) - (1.75 × OD550)]/(volume) (time) (OD600). 2.6. Immunoprecipitation This was performed essentially as previously described [21,26]. Strain EGY194 was transformed with the bait plasmids encoding LexA-tagged Pso5/Rad16 and B42AD­Sgs1 (aa 421­972), encoding HA-tagged Sgs1 (aa 421­792). The cells were grown overnight in liquid SC lacking the appropriate nutrients, using 2% raffinose. When the OD600 was approximately 1, 2% galactose was added to the cultures that were grown for further 4 h. Cell extracts were prepared as described [26] and immunoprecipitations were carried out using anti-LexA goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz). Western blots were probed with the 12CA5 anti-HA monoclonal antibody, using standard techniques [27]. 2.7. Mutagen treatments 2.7.1. MMS and 4-NQO Different cell concentrations in stationary phase of growth were spread in triplicate on YPD plates that had been supplemented with either MMS (Sigma), varying from 0.005 to 0.02% or with 4-NQO (Sigma) at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 M. 2.7.2. UVC Cells were grown in YPD to exponential phase of growth (1­2 × 107 cells per ml). They were harvested, washed and resuspended in sterile saline or water. Different cell concentrations were spread immediately in triplicate on YPD plates and after drying irradiated with UVC (Stratalinker, Stratagene) with doses ranging from 5 to 80 J/m2. 2.7.3. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) A suspension of cells in exponential phase was treated with varying amounts of H2O2 (1­6 mM) at 30C for 1 h. 2.7.4. Drop test Stationary cultures were serially diluted by 1:10 steps and 10 l aliquots then spotted onto rich media plates with or without MMS, H2O2 and 4-NQO. For

UVC treatment, the cells were spotted and then irradiated using the Stratalinker. After all treatments the plates were incubated for 3­5 days at 30C. Survival data represent the average of at least three experiments. 2.8. Analysis of life span Life span was analyzed using the methods described elsewhere [28]. Cells were taken from cultures in exponential phase of growth and plated on YPD. After incubation at 30C for 3 h the daughter cells were isolated as buds that had emerged from mother cells by moving them to non-inhabited regions of the plate using a Zeiss micromanipulator. The life spans of these cells were determined by noting and removing all subsequent daughters they generated. Plates were incubated at 30C during working hours and shifted to 4C overnight.

3. Results 3.1. Isolation of a SGS1 domain interaction with PSO5/RAD16 The yeast two-hybrid system can be a successful approach to identify and analyze protein­protein interaction in vivo. We used the LexA-based system [14,21] to screen a genomic library for proteins interacting with Pso5p. Plasmid pEG­PSO5 (ATG), encoding an in-frame LexA DNA binding domain-Pso5 fusion protein was used to screen a genomic yeast library [27]. A 530,000 primarily obtained transformants were pooled and an aliquot of this pool was plated on selective medium containing galactose for induced expression of the activation domain fusion library. Again, 370 clones able to express the LEU2 reporter gene were picked and re-tested for induced expression of LEU2. Additionally, we tested these clones for their ability to express lacZ as second reporter gene. We could thus isolate 14 clones growing on medium lacking leucin only in the presence of

galactose and also showing blue color on gal/X-gal media. -galactosidase-induced

plasmids induced expression of the reporter genes was re-established, verifying once more the interaction of LexA­Pso5 fusion protein with the respective library encoded proteins. Inserts of positive library plasmids were sequenced. Out of 14 plasmids we identified three containing a genomic DNA fragment coding for the same part of the SGS1 gene. The SGS1 domain identified in this interaction trap screen coded for a 371 amino acid polypeptide (aa 421­792 of the total SGS1 ORF encoding). To ensure that this domain of Sgs1 specifically interacts with Pso5 we tested different false baits for activation of the reporter genes together with the isolated SGS1 prey plasmid. There was no interaction of the SGS1 prey-encoded fusion protein with three different `false baits' (from our baits collection), such as LexA­Pso4 (yeast Prp19 protein), shown in Table 2, LexA­Primase and LexA­Pur (the last two are mammalian proteins). Moreover, we retransformed Sgs1-prey with the truncated bait LexA­Pso5 (aa 82­790) and we found the same interaction then that observed for the full-length LexA­Pso5(aa 1­790), which does not exclude the possibility that this N-terminal part of Pso5/Rad16 protein is not essential for the interaction with Sgs1. Table 2 shows the induced specific expression of lacZ reporter gene in the presence of LexA­Pso5 baits and Sgs1 prey proteins. Therefore, we conclude that the interaction of Pso5 with the isolated Sgs1 domain is specific. SGS1 was originally isolated as a `slow growth suppressor' of top3 mutant strains [15]. Sgs1 has been shown to interact physically with Top2 and Top3 in the two-hybrid system [15,23]. The N-terminal 282 amino acids of Sgs1p contain the domain responsible for the interaction with Top3 [29]. In our screen, the Sgs1 domain (aa 421­792), interacting with Pso5, is overlapping with that identified to interact with Top2 (aa 432­724) [23,29].

Plasmids that directed the synthesis of the DNA-binding domain and activation domain fusion proteins were introduced into EGY194.

In addition to the LexAop­LEU2 reporter, the strain also harbored pSH18­40, a very sensitive LexAop­lacZ reporter. pEG­GAL4 is a transcription activator and was used as positive control; pEG­PSO5 (ATG) and pEG­PSO5 (RsrII) correspond to full-length and N-terminal truncated Pso5 baits, respectively; pEG­PSO4 is a spliceosome Prp19 protein and was used as `false bait'; pEG­Bicoid contains residues 2­160 of the Drosophila bicoid gene product and was used as negative control.

The empty plasmid pEG202, as well as the `false bait' LexA­Pso4, failed to immunoprecipitate with HA-tagged Sgs1 (aa 421­792).

5. Deletion of the SGS1 gene affects RAD16-dependent DNA repair The gene SGS1 has been identified originally as a slow growth suppressor of a top3 mutant strain that also suppresses the genomic instability of this strain [15]. Gene RAD16 is involved in NER and it is essential for global genome repair [7,10]. We have recently shown that the helicase activity of Sgs1p is important for DNA-induced damage in sgs1 mutant strains [30]. If interaction between Rad16p and Sgs1p has any biological significance we might expect that mutations of the SGS1 gene would affect the DNA repair phenotype of a rad16 mutant. To test this assumption we constructed a set of isogenic yeast strains, containing rad16 , sgs1 , or both the rad16 sgs1 deletions and determined their sensitivity towards several mutagens. In Fig. 2A the data for survival after MMS treatment show that the rad16 strain is relatively resistant to MMS, compared with the WT strain, whereas the sgs1 mutant has a lower survival by more than two orders of magnitude at 0.02% MMS. Interestingly, the double mutant rad16 sgs1 was significantly

less sensitive to this treatment than the sgs1 mutant. single

Fig. 2B and C show the results of UVC and 4-NQO sensitivity-tests for the same set of mutants. For both treatments the double mutant rad16 sgs1 displays a slightly decreased sensitivity compared with the more sensitive rad16 single mutant, but is significantly more sensitive than the sgs1 single mutant or

locus, will also lead to mutagen sensitivity phenotypes. To date, only the UVC sensitivity of a top3 mutant has been reported [32]. When we submitted yeast strains containing the top3 mutation either alone or together with sgs1 or with sgs1 and rad16 mutants to a set of mutagens we indeed found that the top3 strain was highly sensitive to MMS, 4-NQO, H2O2 (in decreasing order) and UVC (Fig. 3). Apart from UVC the top3 mutant was always the most sensitive, whereas the sgs1 top3 double mutant exhibited increased resistance (Fig. 3). The MMS sensitivity was restored to sgs1 levels in the sgs1 top3 double and sgs1 top3 rad16 triple mutants, whereas top3 rad16 was more resistant than the single mutant sgs1 . The double mutant sgs1

rad16 Fig. 2. showed the same sensitivity as observed in

After UVC treatment, the double mutant top3 rad16 has shown to be the most sensitive strain, although sgs1 rad16 and sgs1 top3 rad16 have also demonstrated increased sensitivity comparing to all single mutants. Similar results were observed for double and triple mutants after H2O2 treatment (Fig. 3). In contrast to the UVC data, after treatment with the UV-mimetic 4-NQO, the top3 alone and the double and triple mutants showed a complete loss of cell viability.

Fig. 2. SGS1 is involved in yeast DNA repair. Haploid wild type ( ) and isogenic strains carrying a rad16 ( ), sgs1 ( ) and rad16 sgs1 ( ) allele were assayed for their MMS (A); UVC (B); 4-NQO (C); and H2O2 (D) sensitivities (see Section 2).

6. Life span is slightly altered in rad16 mutants

the WT. This epistatic interaction indicates that both gene products may function in a common pathway of repair of UVC and 4-NQO-induced DNA lesions. It is interesting to note that sgs1 alone also conferred sensitivity to UVC, as previously reported [30,31] and 4-NQO, although not as strongly as observed for the rad16 allele. Fig. 2D clearly shows that sgs1 mutant, as already seen for the pso5-1 mutant [2], is also sensitive to the oxidative agent H2O2. The magnitude of H2O2 cytotoxicity is even more pronounced in sgs1 . The

double mutant rad16 sgs1 same sensitivity as the rad16 shows practically the mutant.

SGS1 has been shown to be involved in the life span determination of yeast [16]. Mutation of the SGS1 gene results in a drastically reduced life span of about 40% of the wild-type (Fig. 4). Therefore, we tested the effect of a rad16 mutation on life span in a WT and a sgs1 background. Fig. 4 shows life span analysis for the different strains. Average life span of the rad16 single mutant is reduced by six generations compared to the WT strain. This life span reduction is significant, but not as drastic as that observed for the sgs1 strain. Therefore, the RAD16/PSO5 gene seems to be involved in life span determination. The rad16 sgs1 double mutant strain displayed a life span comparable to the sgs1 single mutant strain. This epistatic interaction of rad16 and sgs1 mutations suggests that RAD16/PSO5 and SGS1 share functions in the same pathway of life span control.

Sgs1p is known to interact with Top3p [15]. It might, therefore, be possible that mutations in the TOP3 gene, as shown for mutations in the RAD16

7. Discussion The PSO5/RAD16 gene of S. cerevisiae involved in NER, especially in global genome repair, is essential for the repair of the nontranscribed strand of active genes and of silent DNA regions in the genome [4,5,7]. Our interaction trap screen using the full-length PSO5 gene as bait and a genomic yeast library to find genes encoding proteins interacting with Pso5p, yielded 14 positive clones. Amongst these we identified three plasmids containing the same DNA fragment coding for an internal part of the Sgs1 protein. The SGS1 domain fused to the activation domain plasmid induced specific expression of the lacZ reporter gene in the presence of LexA­Pso5p (aa 1­790) and LexA­Pso5p (aa 82­790) (Table 2). This interaction was also indicated by co-immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged Sgs1p (aa 421­792) with both full length and N-terminal truncated Pso5p (Fig. 1). SGS1 was originally identified as an extragenic suppressor that suppresses both slow growth and the increased genomic instability of top3, mutant strains. In addition, sgs1 cells accumulate large number of extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA (rDNA) circles (ERCs) and ERC accumulation in yeast leads to senescence [33]. Two hybrid and in vitro binding experiments indicated that Sgs1p interacts with Top2p and Top3p [15,23]. The domain that interacts with Top3p

is localized in the N-terminal of the Sgs1p, but it has been shown that the C-terminal part of Sgs1p is essential for function in a top3 mutant [29,34]. The domain identified for Top2p interaction is localized between aa 432 and 724 of the Sgs1p. In our screen, we identified a part of Sgs1p from aa 421 to 792 to interact with Pso5p. This overlaps with the Top2p interacting region as described by Watt et al. in 1995 [23]. Since we do not know what part of the isolated Sgs1p domain is really interacting with Pso5p or Top2p, respectively, we cannot exclude the existence of two different domains, each interacting with either one of the proteins. There are seven highly conserved helicase domains in the amino acid sequence of Sgs1. This region displays homology with E. coli RecQp, and the human BLM, WRN and RECQL4 proteins. Mutations in these genes lead to the human disorders Bloom's (BS), Werner's (WS) and Rothmund­Thomson syndromes (RTS), respectively. Patients with BS and WS suffer from high incidence of cancers and growth retardation, whereas individuals with RTS and WS age prematurely [35]. Sgs1p displays a 3 ­5 helicase and a DNA-dependent ATPase activities in vitro [34,36]. Rad16p contains seven helicase domains as well and shows high homology with Rad54p and Rad5p, two putative helicase proteins involved in DNA repair and also with the transcription factors Snf2p and Mot1p [4,5]. The observed sensitivities of sgs1 to UVC, MMS, 4-NQO and H2O2 (Fig. 2) confirm and extend the findings of Gangloff et al. [31] who described sgs1 to be sensitive to UVC and -ray irradiation. This indicates an involvement of Sgs1p in DNA repair. Recent results are consistent with the idea that the helicase activity of Sgs1p is responsible for most elements of the sgs1 phenotype [30]. However, helicase activity is not essential for Sgs1p function in a top3 background [34]. The interaction of sgs1 mutant alleles with other helicase or topoisomerase mutants is complex and depends on the mutagen used for the sensitivity assay (Fig. 3). Most of the sgs1 mutant alleles confer high MMS sensitivity [37] (Fig. 3) but, in conjunction with a rad16 mutant allele that itself confers little MMS sensitivity, a significantly increased MMS resistance is observed (Figs. 2A and 3). The joint absence of functional Sgs1p and Rad16p either saves the MMS-treated cell from a lethal (repair) process or channels the DNA lesions to a successful mode of repair. Recently, mutations in SGS1 have been demonstrated to be

synthetically lethal in combination with mutation in SRS2 [38]. Srs2p is also a 3 ­5 helicase that mediates DNA repair and recombination [39,40]. It is known that the absence of Rad51p and hence, absence of homologous recombination, will rescue a sgs1 srs2 double mutant from cell death [31]. In our case the absence of Sgs1p and of the putative helicase Rad16p could prevent the initiation of excessive homologous recombination as well and could allow for the other modes of repair of the MMS-induced DNA lesions. The interaction of these two mutant alleles, however, yields different results after treatment with UVC or with the UV-mimetic 4-NQO (Fig. 3). The sensitivity of rad16 increases by introducing sgs1 mutation. This indicates lack of repair of DNA lesions via excision repair or conversion to a substrate for aberrant repair [40]. It seems that in a top3 mutant functional Sgs1p and Rad16p channel MMS, 4-NQO and H2O2 induced DNA lesions into aberrant DNA repair leading to very high sensitivity (Fig. 3). For MMS- and H2O2-induced DNA lesions the absence of either Sgs1p or Rad16p already leads to better reparability resulting in better cell survival in top3 background (Fig. 3). The mutagen-specific differences in the sensitivity of double and triple mutants point to a selective interaction of Sgs1p and Rad16p with the DNA lesions. One possibility would be that sgs1 mutant changes the structure of the genome affecting the damage, repair and survival characteristics of the strain. In this respect, it has been shown that the sir3 mutation, which affects the chromatin structure in yeast, was able to partially suppress the UV sensitivity phenotype of rad7 mutant [12]. Given the large number of helicases in a yeast cell one is tempted to speculate that there might exist specific helicases for the selective channeling into a correct repair pathway for certain types or groups of DNA lesions. In conjunction with the proposed Top3p­Sgs1p dependent repair of DNA single strand breaks [32] this would lead to a different networking of DNA repair. Disruptive mutation of the DNA repair gene RAD16 reduces the average life span of the mutants significantly (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the DNA repair proteins Rad7p (the Rad16p partner in NER), Rad1p and Rad26p do not show any reduction in life span [41]. Rad1p and Rad26p that also function in NER are involved in removing non-homologous single-strand ends of a DSB and transcription-coupled repair,

respectively [42,43]. The apparent life span reduction observed for rad16/pso5 mutants (Fig. 4) suggests that the RAD52 DNA repair pathway (RAD50, RAD51, RAD52 and RAD57 gene products) [41] involved in DSBs and homologous recombinational repair (cf. [44]) is not unique in shortening of life span in yeast. In this paper we have given some evidence that Rad16p and Sgs1p interact genetically and physically. We suggest here that, besides the involvement of Sgs1 in genome stability, somatic recombination and aging [15,16,23], this protein, together with Pso5p/Rad16p, is also involved in the repair of specific DNA damage. In addition, both helicases, in conjunction with top3, can act in processing DNA lesions in order to maintain the integrity of DNA, mainly during its synthesis. The Sgs1/Top3/Rad16 complex can be involved in the preparation of the substrates for repair by homologous recombination or even prevent undesirable intermediates for recombination that would activate the cell cycle checkpoint machinery. Moreover, the rad16 mutation confers a reduction in life span, indicating that (a) the protein encoded by RAD16 has some role in aging; or (b) the defect in the ability to repair DNA can result in reduced life span.
