Regulation of MAPK Function by Direct Interaction with the Mating-Specific G in Yeast

Metodi V. Metodiev,1 Dina Matheos,2 Mark D. Rose,2 David E. Stone1* The mating response of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is mediated by a prototypical heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G protein) and mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. Although signal transmission by such pathways has been modeled in detail, postreceptor down-regulation is less well understood. The pheromone-responsive G protein subunit (G ) of yeast down-regulates the mating signal, but its targets are unknown. We have found that G binds directly to the mating-specific MAPK in yeast cells responding to pheromone. This interaction contributes both to modulation of the mating signal and to the chemotropic response, and it demonstrates direct communication between the top and bottom of a G -MAPK pathway.

The pheromone response system of S. cerevisiae, which enables haploid cells of opposite mating type to sense one another's presence and to differentiate into gametes, uses signaling molecules found in all eukaryotic cells. Upon binding ligand, the pheromone receptor activates its associated heterotrimeric G protein, causing the G and G subunits to dissociate. G then interacts with a p21activated protein kinase (PAK) homolog, Ste20, and a scaffolding protein, Ste5, to stimulate a MAPK module composed of Ste11 [the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MEKK)], Ste7 [the mitogenactivated protein kinase kinase (MEK)], and Fus3 (the MAPK). The activated form of Fus3 is thought to translocate to the nucleus (1), where it phosphorylates targets that effect changes in gene expression and that block cell-cycle progression (2). In addition to stimulating the MAPK cascade, G is critical for polarized growth toward pheromone (3). Although G plays a positive signaling role, the pheromone-responsive G protein, Gpa1, negatively regulates the mating signal (4, 5). In its inactive (GDP-bound) form, Gpa1 couples G to the receptor. When activated, Gpa1 promotes adaptation to pheromone by mechanisms that have not been well defined, although genetic evidence suggests that Gpa1-GTP down-regulates the mating response by stimulating an unknown protein to interact with G (6) and by antagonizing the function of Fus3 (7, 8). To identify putative Gpa1 effectors, a

glutathione S-transferase (GST)­tagged

two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Several polypeptides that bound specifically to the GST-Gpa1 matrix, and not to GST control beads, were recovered [fig. S1 (9)]. One of these polypeptides was enriched in the samples derived from cells treated with mating pheromone. After the polypeptides were subjected to in-gel trypsinization and the masses of the resulting fragments determined, a database search revealed that the pheromone-inducible spot was the mating-specific MAPK, Fus3. The pheromone-responsive G moiety, Ste4, was also identified. Thus, GST-Gpa1 precipitated molecules at the top of the pheromone response pathway, as well as downstream in the pathway. To confirm Gpa1 association with Fus3, an affinity matrix was made with histidinetagged Gpa1 purified from Escherichia coli. A yeast strain was constructed in which the genomic copy of FUS3 was replaced by a COOH-terminal Myc-tagged form of FUS3 expressed from its own promoter. This strain was cultured with and without pheromone, and whole-cell lysates were prepared. The Gpa1 affinity matrix

form of Gpa1 was expressed in yeast cells, and glutathione-agarose pull-down experiments were performed (9). Copurifying proteins were identified by high-resolution

After extensive washing, the bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting using a polyclonal antibody against Myc. (B) Fus3 associates with Gpa1 in vivo. Fus3Myc immunoprecipitates were probed for the presence of Gpa1 with antibody against Gpa1. The cultures were treated with pheromone as indicated.

Lysates from pheromone-treated and untreated yeast cells expressing Fus3-Myc were incubated overnight with lysates from yeast cells expressing GST or GST-Gpa1. Gpa1 was precipitated with GSH affinity beads, and the bound proteins were probed with an monoclonal antibody against pTEpY that reacts specifically with the doubly phosphorylated MAPKs. (F) Physical association of bacterially expressed Fus3 and Gpa1. A His-tagged form of Fus3 and untagged forms of Gpa1 were expressed in E. coli. Equal amounts of the Fus3 and Gpa1 [either wild type ( WT ) or the mutant Gpa1E364K (EK)] containing lysates were mixed, incubated in the presence of 5 mM MgSO4 and 100 M GTP- -S for 30 min at room temperature, and His-Fus3 was purified on Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin. Bound proteins were probed with a polyclonal antibody against Gpa1.

specifically bound Fus3-Myc from cells treated with pheromone (Fig. 1A), but not from untreated cells (9­11). Endogenous Gpa1 in lysates from pheromone-treated cells was also coimmunoprecipitated with Fus3-Myc by a Myc-specific antibody (Fig. 1B). Because pheromone both induces the de novo synthesis of Gpa1 and Fus3 (12) and activates their signaling functions (2), the pheromone dependence of the Gpa1-Fus3 association could be explained in a number of ways. Two observations suggest that activation of Gpa1 is an important factor. Loading the Gpa1 matrix with GTP- -S increased its binding to Fus3-Myc [Fig. 1A and fig. S2 (9)]. Also, when lysates from pheromone-treated Fus3-Myc­expressing cells were mixed with lysates from pheromone-treated and untreated GST-Gpa1­ expressing cells, the strongest Gpa1-Fus3 interaction was observed with GST-Gpa1 prepared from the pheromone-stimulated cells (Fig. 1C). This effect was not due to increased GSTGPA1, because the tagged Gpa1 was expressed from the CUP1 promoter, which is not induced by pheromone (12). Rather, pheromone most likely increased the Gpa1-Fus3 interaction by activating Gpa1. To distinguish the effects of pheromone-induced activation and pheromoneinduced expression of Fus3 lysates containing Fus3-Myc were treated with phosphatase before testing for association with Gpa1. Phosphatase treatment decreased the amount of Fus3-Myc precipitated by Gpa1, indicating that Gpa1 preferentially associates with the phosphorylated (activated) Fus3 (Fig. 1D). In addition, a protein of about the mass of Fus3 was identified by Western blot analysis of Gpa1associated proteins with an antibody (against pTEpY) that recognizes only activated MAPK (Fig. 1E). To determine whether Gpa1 can interact directly with Fus3, a histidine-tagged form of Fus3 was purified from E. coli on a nickel column and tested for the ability to pull out Gpa1 from a bacterial lysate. Bacterially expressed Gpa1 bound to the bacterially expressed His-Fus3, suggesting that the two proteins can interact directly (Fig. 1F). Phosphatase treatment of the His-Fus3 produced in E. coli also decreased its interaction with Gpa1 (9, 10, 13). In addition, a hyperadaptive mutant form of Gpa1 (Gpa1E364K) bound to His-Fus3 considerably better than did wildtype Gpa1 (14). To ascertain the functional significance of the Gpa1-Fus3 interaction, we studied the effect of disrupting it. Recently, a MAPK docking motif was discovered in Ste7, the MEK that directly activates Fus3 (15). This motif, LQ_RR_N_LKGLNLNL (14), was shown to be necessary and sufficient to bind GST to the yeast MAPKs Fus3 and Kss1 and to their mammalian ortholog, Erk2. A MAPK-binding sequence was identified in

Gpa1 (residues 21 to 33) and in four other proteins known to interact with Fus3 (fig. S3). To determine whether the putative Fus3 docking motif is critical for the function of Gpa1, we changed residues lysine 21 and arginine 22 to glutamate in wild-type Gpa1, and in two mutant Gpa1 proteins, Gpa1E364K and Gpa1G322E. Although both Gpa1E364K and Gpa1G322E inhibit the mating signal, they do so by distinct mechanisms. Gpa1E364K is an activated form of G that promotes hyperadaptation to pheromone, whereas Gpa1G322E is an inactivated form of G that confers insensitivity to pheromone (5, 16). The various mutant alleles of GPA1 were transformed into a gpa1 GAL1-GPA1 strain (5), and the expression of wild-type Gpa1 was turned off. All mutant forms of Gpa1 conferred normal growth to cells lacking wildtype Gpa1, indicating that the K21E R22E double-mutation does not disrupt G -G binding (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, mutation of the putative Fus3 docking site did compromise the ability of Gpa1 to promote adaptation to pheromone. Cells expressing to pheromone-induced cell-cycle arrest in assays of single-colony formation (Fig. 2, A and B) (17), and unlike Gpa1E364K, modest hyperadaptivity (Fig. 2B). The G322E mutant form of Gpa1, which is thought to confer resistance to pheromone by sequestering G , was largely unaffected by the K21E R22E mutation. As expected, the

Gpa1K21E R22E exhibited enhanced sensitivity

Gpa1K21E R22E E364K conferred only very

binding of Gpa1K21E R22E to Fus3-Myc in

vivo was impaired (Fig. 2C). The inverse correlation between Gpa1Fus3 interaction and Gpa1-mediated adaptation is consistent with the idea that Gpa1 directly inhibits Fus3 signaling. Gpa1 could anchor Fus3 in the cytoplasm and prevent communication of the mating signal to the nucleus. Consistent with this possibility, we have found that Gpa1E364K reduces the localization of a Fus3-GFP reporter to the nuclei of cells responding to pheromone (10). Gpa1 could also target Fus3 for degradation, as activated Gpa1 is subject to regulated degradation by the N-end rule pathway (18), and the Gpa1-Fus3 interaction might mark the kinase for the same fate. Gpa1 might also inhibit the catalytic function of Fus3. Fus3 kinase activity was inhibited in vitro by wild-type Gpa1 equilibrated with GTP- -S, but was unaffected by inactive (GDP-bound) Gpa1 [fig. S2 (9)]. Gpa1E364K inhibited Fus3 activity when equilibrated with either GDP or GTP, consistent with its hyperadaptive activity. Although these results do not necessarily reflect the effect of Gpa1 on Fus3 activity in vivo, they argue against the possibility that Gpa1 stimulates Fus3. In contrast, the binding of mammalian G proteins to tyrosine kinases induces kinase activity (19­ 22). In addition to down-regulating the cellcycle inhibitory effect of Fus3, we considered the possibility that Gpa1-Fus3 interaction plays a positive role in mating.

omone, yeast cells reorganize their cytoskeletons and polarize their growth in the direction of highest concentration of ligand. This phenomenon is called chemotropism: mating partners grow toward one another and eventually fuse at their tips. Gpa1 and Far1, a substrate of Fus3, have been implicated in the chemotropic response (3, 23), and Fus3 is required for cell fusion (24). Moreover, both Gpa1 and Fus3 concentrate at the tips of the mating projections [fig. S4 (9)]. If Gpa1 serves to localize Fus3 to the sites of polarized growth, and if Fus3 must get to these sites to promote chemotropism and/or cellular fusion, then we would expect the K21E R22E allele of GPA1 to confer a defect in with about 1/15th the efficiency of isogenic cells expressing wild-type GPA1 (Fig. 3A). The mutant cells also exhibited a defect in chemotropism: When challenged with a mixture of pheromone-secreting and nonsecreting mating partners, the mutant cells were about 50 times more likely than wildtype cells to mate with the nonsecretors (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that wildtype mating efficiency depends on the interaction between Fus3 and Gpa1, and that the mating defect conferred by gpa1K21E of the mutant cells to orient toward their mating partners. Ste4 is rapidly phosphorylated on multiple sites in cells responding to pheromone, and this is partially dependent on Fus3 (25) and Gpa1 (26). Moreover, the G -Far1 complex is thought to mark the site of chemotropic growth. Therefore, we tested the effect of the K21E R22E substitutions in Gpa1 on the fate of Ste4 after pheromone stimulation. Two creased the phosphorylation and the level of Ste4 in stimulated cells (Fig. 4). Moreover, a mutant form of Ste4 that cannot be phospho-

in chemotropism similar in magnitude to that explain these findings is to postulate that in cells exposed to a physiological gradient of pheromone, Gpa1 recruits Fus3 to the incipient mating projection site. There, the kinase phosphorylates Ste4, which promotes assembly or stabilization of the G -Far1 complex required for chemotropic growth. To date, heterotrimeric G protein and MAPK signaling pathways have been modeled as linear. However, the pheromoneresponsive G protein at the top of the yeast mating pathway interacts directly with the MAPK at the end of the pathway. This interaction may serve two seemingly contradictory purposes: The supersensitive or adaptive-negative phenotype conferred by disruption of Gpa1-Fus3 interaction suggests that Gpa1 promotes adaptation to pheromone by down-regulating Fus3, whereas the mating and/or chemotropic defects conferred by disruption of Gpa1-Fus3 interaction suggest that Gpa1 potentiates the function of Fus3 in polarization and/or conjugation. How might Gpa1 act as both a negative and a positive regulator of Fus3? Gpa1 may recruit Fus3 to the sites of polarized growth in mating projections where the kinase phosphorylates targets involved in chemotropism and cell fusion. In so doing, Gpa1 diverts Fus3 away from the nu-

caused by gpa1K21E R22E (10). One way to

cleus, thereby modulating the intensity and duration of the mating response. Given the structural conservation of G proteins and MAPKs, as well as the conservation of their functional relationships, other examples of G -MAPK interactions are possible. In fact, sequences similar to the MAPK docking motif found in Ste7 and Gpa1 are present near the NH2-termini of the mammalian G proteins Golf, Gq, G13, and G14 (fig. S3). References and Notes 1.

The affinity of the Gpa1-Fus3 interaction must be high, as the complex remained bound to the affinity support after extensive washing with high salts and detergents. It is also apparent that the Gpa1-Fus3 association requires the NH2-terminus of Fus3: Truncated forms of Fus3 that retained the COOH-terminal Myc tag were abundant in the lysate, but did not bind to the Gpa1 affinity matrix.

Induction of Cachexia in Mice by Systemically Administered Myostatin

Teresa A. Zimmers,1* Monique V. Davies,2 Leonidas G. Koniaris,1* Paul Haynes,2 Aurora F. Esquela,1 Kathy N. Tomkinson,2 Alexandra C. McPherron,1 Neil M. Wolfman,2 Se-Jin Lee1 Mice and cattle with genetic deficiencies in myostatin exhibit dramatic increases in skeletal muscle mass, suggesting that myostatin normally suppresses muscle growth. Whether this increased muscling results from prenatal or postnatal lack of myostatin activity is unknown. Here we show that myostatin circulates in the blood of adult mice in a latent form that can be activated by acid treatment. Systemic overexpression of myostatin in adult mice was found to induce profound muscle and fat loss analogous to that seen in human cachexia syndromes. These data indicate that myostatin acts systemically in adult animals and may be a useful pharmacologic target in clinical settings such as cachexia, where muscle growth is desired.

Myostatin [growth/differentiation factor-8 (GDF-8)] is a transforming growth factor(TGF- ) family member that is essential for proper regulation of skeletal muscle mass (1). Myostatin is expressed almost exclusively in cells of the skeletal muscle lineage, from embryonic myotome to striated muscle in adults. Mice carrying a targeted deletion of the gene encoding myostatin (Mstn) have a dramatic and widespread increase in muscle mass, suggesting that myostatin normally acts as a negative regulator of muscle growth. Individual muscles of Mstn­/­ mice weigh 100 to 200% more than those of control animals as a result of muscle fiber hypertrophy and hyperplasia.

does not appear to be essential for either viability or fertility, Mstn has been remarkably well conserved through evolution; hu-

man, rat, murine, porcine, turkey, and chicken myostatin protein sequences are identical in the biologically active COOH terminus of the protein (2). The function of myostatin also appears to have been conserved, as Mstn mutations in cattle cause the double-muscling phenotype (2­5). Because the myostatin lossof-function phenotype could result entirely from lack of myostatin activity during embryonic development, the role that myostatin plays in adult animals is unknown. To determine whether myostatin acts in an endocrine fashion in adult mice, we sought to identify myostatin in serum. Myostatin is synthesized as a pre-proprotein activated by two proteolytic cleavages. Removal of the signal sequence is followed by cleavage at a tetrabasic processing site, resulting in a 26kD NH2-terminal propeptide and a 12.5-kD COOH-terminal peptide, a dimer of which is the biologically active portion of the protein. Western blot analysis revealed a 12.5-kD protein in the serum of wild-type but not Mstn­ mice that comigrated with purified

/­

recombinant myostatin (Fig. 1A). Next, we measured myostatin activity in

Western blot analysis was then performed with the use of a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against bacterially expressed recombinant myostatin COOH-terminal protein. Location of myostatin COOH-terminal monomer is indicated by arrow. Higher molecular weight bands were also detected in the serum of both wild-type and knockout mice, including a clear band around 25,000. Similar nonspecific bands may have given rise to the identification in other reports of a 26-kD "myostatin-related protein" in the blood (27) and muscle (27­31) of mice and humans.
