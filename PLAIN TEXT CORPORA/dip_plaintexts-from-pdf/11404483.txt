Exit from mitosis in budding yeast requires inactivation of cyclindependent kinases through mechanisms triggered by the protein phosphatase Cdc14. Cdc14 activity, in turn, is regulated by a group of proteins, the mitotic exit network (MEN), which includes Lte1, Tem1, Cdc5, Cdc15, Dbf2 Dbf20, and Mob1. The direct biochemical interactions between the components of the MEN remain largely unresolved. Here, we investigate the mechanisms that underlie activation of the protein kinase Dbf2. Dbf2 kinase activity depended on Tem1, Cdc15, and Mob1 in vivo. In vitro, recombinant protein kinase Cdc15 activated recombinant Dbf2, but only when Dbf2 was bound to Mob1. Conserved phosphorylation sites Ser374 and Thr-544 (present in the human, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster relatives of Dbf2) were required for DBF2 function in vivo, and activation of Dbf2-Mob1 by Cdc15 in vitro. Although Cdc15 phosphorylated Dbf2, Dbf2­Mob1, and Dbf2(S374A T544A)­Mob1, the pattern of phosphate incorporation into Dbf2 was substantially altered by either the S374A T544A mutations or omission of Mob1. Thus, Cdc15 promotes the exit from mitosis by directly switching on the kinase activity of Dbf2. We propose that Mob1 promotes this activation process by enabling Cdc15 to phosphorylate the critical Ser-374 and Thr-544 phosphoacceptor sites of Dbf2.

T he cell cycle in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is controlled by a single cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk), Cdc28. By associating

(GAP) Bub2-Bfa1 Byr4 at the cytoplasmic face of the spindle pole body (SPB). Tem1 presumably becomes activated when the spindle pole is translocated into the bud, which brings it into proximity with Lte1 (19, 20). The functional organization of the remaining components of the MEN is unclear. Protein kinase Cdc15 associates with Tem1 at the spindle pole in mitotic cells, and epistasis analyses suggest that it acts downstream of Lte1 and Tem1 (12, 13, 15, 19). Cdc5, Dbf2, and Dbf20 are also protein kinases (11, 21), but their functional relationship to other MEN components remains obscure. Cdc5 is implicated in a variety of processes in other organisms that do not appear to involve the MEN, including activation of both APC CCdc20 and the protein phosphatase Cdc25 (22). Dbf2 and Dbf20 are functionally redundant homologues, but Dbf2, which is abruptly activated during anaphase, accounts for the majority of the Dbf2 Dbf20-associated kinase activity (21, 23). The biochemical function of Mob1 is unknown, but Mob1 binds Dbf2, and the lethality of a dbf2 dbf20 is rescued by Mob1 overexpression (16, 17). To gain greater insight into the functional organization of the MEN, we examined the interaction between Dbf2, Mob1, and Cdc15. Here, we provide both genetic and biochemical evidence that Cdc15 directly phosphorylates and activates Dbf2. Surprisingly, this activation step depends on Mob1. Materials and Methods Yeast Methods. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. All strains are derivatives of W303 (can1-100, leu2-3, -112, and his3-11, -15, trp1-1, ura3-1, ade2-1). Chromosomal DBF2 in haploid strains was tagged with FlagHis6HA3 (FHH) by transformation with StuI-linearized p03-DBF2TS (RDB884), a pRS303 (24) plasmid with nucleotides 266 to 45 of DBF2, the PCR-generated FHH tag, followed by nucleotides 49 to 425 of DBF2 inserted into the PvuII site. Diploid strains were with untagged strains, with the exception of YAM2, in which the untagged strains were mated and the resulting diploid strain (YAM10) was transformed with p03-DBF2TS. The dbf2-2 strain, RJD1218, was transformed with pAM17, pAM18, pAM19, pAM20, pAM21, and pRS129, to obtain strains YAM4, YAM5, YAM6, YAM7, YAM8, and YAM9, respectively, and grown on minimal media (SD) supplemented with the appropriate nutrients, excluding tryptophan. All other strains were grown in 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose (YPD). Plasmid and Baculovirus Constructions. The plasmids constructed for this study are listed in Table 2.

with different cyclins, Cdc28 activity orchestrates cell cycle progression. After sister chromatid separation, mitotic Cdk activity is extinguished, and cells exit mitosis. Separation of sister chromatids and inactivation of mitotic Cdk are both regulated by proteolysis via the anaphase-promoting complex cyclosome (APC C) ubiquitin ligase. The APC C in cooperation with the substrate specificity factor Cdc20 initiates anaphase by targeting the anaphase inhibitor Pds1 for degradation (1). Pds1 forms a complex with the separin Esp1, thereby preventing Esp1 from cleaving Scc1, a cohesin subunit that helps hold sister chromatids together (2, 3). Pds1 also impedes Cdk inactivation by preventing release of protein phosphatase Cdc14 from the nucleolus (4). Cdc14, which is tethered to the nucleolus in an inactive state by Net1 Cfi1 (5, 6), promotes cyclin degradation on its release from the nucleolus in anaphase by removing inhibitory phosphates from Cdh1 Hct1, which then targets Clb2 to the APC C for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (7­9). Cdc14 also promotes the accumulation of the Cdk inhibitor Sic1 by dephosphorylating Sic1 and its transcription factor, Swi5, thereby stabilizing the former and allowing the latter to enter the nucleus (8). Mobilization of Cdc14 activity during anaphase depends on a group of genes (LTE1, TEM1, CDC5, CDC15, DBF2 DBF20, and MOB1) that comprise the mitotic exit network (MEN). Loss of function of the MEN causes cells to arrest in late anaphase telophase, similar to the arrest caused by overexpression of non-degradable B-type cyclin (10). Components of the MEN interact genetically with each other and act upstream of Cdc14 as suggested by epistasis studies (8, 11­17). Lte1, a putative guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), and Tem1, a GTPbinding protein, are likely to be at the top of this pathway (12, 15, 18). Lte1 is concentrated at the bud cortex, and Tem1 associates with the heterodimeric GTPase-activating protein

and details of constructs are available on request. All PCRamplified coding sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. FHH and the N-terminal portion of DBF2 (nucleotides 49 to 437) were amplified by PCR from p03DBF2TS with primers that generated RsrII and EcoRI sites at the 5 and 3 ends, respectively. The remainder of DBF2 was obtained as an EcoRI fragment from pRS304-DBF2-myc (a gift from C. L. Denis, University of New Hampshire). The two fragments were ligated into the RsrII EcoRI sites of pFastBac1 (GIBCO BRL) to yield pAM1. DBF2 was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis using pAM1 as a template, to create a kinase-inactive mutant (pAM7) and the phosphorylation site mutants (pAM8, pAM9, and pAM10). MOB1 was cloned into pFastBacHTa(-XhoI), which contains a His6 (H6) tag and lacks the XhoI site, removed by XhoI cleavage, followed by Klenow fill-in before religation. MOB1 was amplified from pRSETA-MOB1(1-314) (a gift from F. Luca, University of Pennsylvania) by PCR, creating a BamHI site at the 5 end and XhoI and EcoRI sites at the 3 end. MOB1 was ligated into the BamHI EcoRI sites of pFastBacHTa(-XhoI) to yield pAM4. An XhoI-EcoRI fragment that contained the TEV2Myc9 (TM9) tagging cassette (two tobacco etch virus protease sites followed by nine copies of the Myc epitope and a stop codon) was ligated into the XhoI EcoRI sites of pAM4 to yield pAM5. The

Bac-to-Bac baculovirus system (GIBCO BRL) was subsequently used to generate recombinant baculoviruses. DBF2 was subcloned into pRS129, a pRS314-based (CEN ARS) plasmid with a GAL1 promoter, for RJD1218 transformations. pAM1 was cleaved with RsrII, the ends blunted, and SpeI sites of pRS129, yielding pAM17. The same procedure was used for obtaining pAM18, pAM19, pAM20, and pAM21 (Table 2). Yeast Extract Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assay. Yeast strains were grown in YPD at 25°C to an OD600 of 0.5, and half of each culture was shifted to 37°C for 3 h, until greater than 90% of the cells at 37°C had arrested. Approximately twenty-five OD600 units of cells were harvested and washed with Solution A (150 mM NaCl 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4) and resuspended in 200 l Lysis Buffer (150 mM NaCl 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 1% Triton X-100 10% glycerol 2 mM DTT 25 g/ml aprotinin 10 g/ml pepstatin 10 g/ml chymostatin 10 g/ml leupeptin 1 mM benzamidine 1 mM PMSF 10 mM NaF, 60 mM -glycerophosphate 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate 2 mM sodium vanadate). An equal volume of glass beads was added, and the cells were lysed by eight cycles of vortexing and icing, at 30-s intervals. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation and supplemented with 1 l 12CA5 (anti-HA monoclonal antibody), incubated on ice for 1 h, then added to 10 l of Protein A beads (Sigma).

The proteins Tem1, Cdc15, Cdc5, Dbf2, and Mob1 form a poorly understood regulatory network that controls exit from mitosis (5, 6, 8, 11­17). To gain insight into the regulation of exit from mitosis, we sought to position Dbf2 within this network by measuring Dbf2 kinase activity in various mutant strains.

result was unexpected, because Mob1 has been proposed to function downstream of Dbf2 (16). It was also noted in repeated from the mob1-77 diploid strain was reduced in comparison to remained unchanged in cdc14-1 and wild-type cells. Taken together, these observations suggested that Dbf2 required signaling by MEN proteins to become activated, and that Dbf2 acted at or near the terminus of the MEN, before the mobilization of Cdc14. Mob1 Is Required for Obtaining Active Dbf2 from Okadaic AcidTreated Insect Cells. Tem1 is thought to act near the top of the MEN, and a combination of genetic and biochemical evidence suggests strongly that Cdc15 acts directly downstream of Tem1 (12, 13, 15, 19). Thus, we reasoned that Cdc15, Cdc5, and or Mob1 might directly activate Dbf2. To distinguish between these possibilities, we sought to reconstitute Dbf2 activation in vitro with recombinant proteins. Because Cdc15 and Cdc5 are protein kinases, we first tested the possibility that Dbf2 is activated by infection with a recombinant baculovirus, and cells were incubated either with or without the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic from okadaic acid-treated cells migrated more slowly on SDS PAGE, suggesting that okadaic acid promoted accumulation of theless, this material did not exhibit kinase activity (Lower). Because Dbf2 kinase activity depended on Mob1 in vivo (Fig. 1B), we tested whether Mob1 influenced the recovery of Dbf2 kinase activity from insect cells. Hi5 cells were coinfected with

Dbf2 may phosphorylate itself and its Mob1 partner. To confirm that Cdc15H6 activated FHHDbf2-H6Mob1TM9 by phosphorylation, we obtained from D. Morgan (University of California, San Francisco) a recombinant baculovirus that expressed a Cdc15H6 mutant previously shown to lack kinase activity, in which the conserved lysine was mutated to leucine (15). As shown in Fig. 3C, Mob1TM9. We conclude that Cdc15 phosphorylated both Dbf2 and Mob1, and that phosphorylation of one or both of these proteins switched on the kinase activity of Dbf2. Cdc15 Phosphorylates Dbf2 on Ser-374 and Thr-544. Activation of the human serine threonine protein kinase Ndr (nuclear, Dbf2related) requires its phosphorylation on Ser-281 and Thr-444 (27). These residues are conserved in the relatives of Ndr, including Dbf2 (28). To test whether these residues might correspond to sites of phosphorylation by Cdc15, we mutated the corresponding residues double phosphorylation site mutants that were coexpressed with Mob1TM9 in insect cells. All three mutants were incapable of beingactivatedbyCdc15H6(Fig.4A,Bottom,lanes8,9,and10).The molecularweight(lane10,Top)andincorporated[ -32P]ATP(data not shown; see Fig. 4B) when treated with Cdc15H6, suggesting dress whether S374 and T544 were phosphorylated by Cdc15H6, plus [ -32P]ATP and fractionated by SDS PAGE.

Taken together, these data suggest that binding of Mob1 to Dbf2 enables Cdc15 to phosphorylate Dbf2 on Ser-374 and Thr-544, and that phosphorylation of these residues underlies the mobilization of Dbf2 kinase activity. Dbf2 Phosphorylation Sites Ser-374 and Thr-544 Are Required in Vivo. To determine whether Ser-374 and Thr-544 were important for Dbf2 function in vivo, we examined whether DBF2 phosphorylation site mutants, on expression from the GAL1 promoter, were able to rescue the conditional lethal dbf2-2 strain.

Discussion Organizing the MEN. Spindle pole body-associated Tem1 is presumably activated when, on spindle elongation, it contacts guanine nucleotide exchange factor Lte1 in the cortex of the bud (19, 20). Activated Tem1 may enable recruitment of Cdc15 to the SPB, possibly through other proteins such as Nud1 (29). Mob1 would also need to be recruited to the SPB, if as in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Mob1 localizes to the SPB only during mitosis (30, 31). Cdc15 would then be able to activate Dbf2, which appears to be present at the SPB throughout most of the cell cycle (32). Activated Dbf2 presumably phosphorylates one or more substrates, ultimately leading to release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus and exit from mitosis. It remains completely unclear how Cdc5 fits into the mitotic exit network. Dbf2 kinase activity was reduced in cdc5-1 cells grown at the permissive temperature but, in contrast to tem1-3 and cdc15-1 mutants, was not significantly reduced on shift to the nonpermissive temperature. Whereas our observations are consistent with several scenarios, analysis of Cdc5 homologues that regulate cytokinesis place the polo-like kinase upstream in the pathway (22). Further genetic, biochemical, and cytological studies will be required to order Cdc5 function within the MEN.

What Does Mob1 Do? Our data point to Mob1 as playing a key role in the activation of the Dbf2. Dbf2 kinase activity was dramatically lowered at both the permissive and restrictive temperatures in the mob1-77 mob1-77 strain, and Mob1 was absolutely required for the Cdc15-dependent activation of Dbf2 in a reconstituted system that usedpurifiedrecombinantproteins.HowdoesMob1promoteDbf2 activation? Although Cdc15 phosphorylated Dbf2 in the absence of Mob1, phosphorylation of the functionally critical Ser-374 or Thr544 (or both) residues of Dbf2 was strongly stimulated by Mob1. In addition, Mob1 appears to stabilize Dbf2, in that Dbf2 levels were significantly reduced in mob1 mutant cells, and accumulation of Dbf2 in insect cells was significantly improved on coexpression with Mob1 (data not shown). On binding to Dbf2, Mob1 may promote a change in conformation that both stabilizes Dbf2 and facilitates its phosphorylation on Ser-374 and Thr-544 by Cdc15. By analogy, binding of cyclin A causes major conformational changes in Cdk2 (33) that are thought to enable phosphorylation of the critical T160 residue of Cdk2 by the Cdk-activating kinase p40(MO15) (34). Contrary to our results, previous studies have shown that overexpression of Mob1 rescues the lethality of dbf2 dbf20 (16), which would place Mob1 downstream of Dbf2. Mob1 may be a downstream substrate for Dbf2, because phosphorylation of Mob1 was reduced in the kinase-dead Dbf2(N305A) complex (Fig. 3B). Phosphorylation of Mob1 by Dbf2 may enhance, but may not be essential for, a downstream effector function of Mob1, such that overexpression of Mob1 can overcome the normally essential requirement for Dbf2 Dbf20. Studies in S. pombe, however, have shown that mob1 mutants are not rescued by overexpression of Sid2 (the S. pombe ortholog of Dbf2), and vice versa (30, 31). Our data, while arguing that Mob1 functions upstream of Dbf2, do not exclude a downstream function. A final resolution of this issue will require the identification of direct physiological targets of Dbf2Mob1, which to date have remained elusive. MEN and SIN. The septation initiation network (SIN) in S. pombe is an analogous pathway to the MEN. The SIN includes Plo1, Spg1, Cdc7, Sid2, and Mob1, which correspond to the S. cerevisiae homologues Cdc5, Tem1, Cdc15, Dbf2, and Mob1 (30). As in budding yeast, the fission yeast Spg1 is regulated by a two-component GTPase-activating protein consisting of Byr4Cdc16, which holds Spg1 in an inactive GDP-state at the SPB (35). The SIN contains several components with no known counterparts in the MEN, including Sid1, Cdc14, Sid4, and Cdc11 (30). Sid1, associated with Cdc14 (no relation to S. cerevisiae Cdc14), localizes to the SPB with Cdc7-Spg1 during late anaphase, and epistasis analysis places it upstream of Sid2 (36).

Taken together, these observations suggest that unidentified Sid1 and Cdc14 homologues in S. cerevisiae act between Cdc15 and Dbf2 (22). It remains possible, albeit unlikely, that an insect cell protein kinase binds tightly to either Cdc15 or Dbf2-Mob1, and is directly responsible for the activation of Dbf2. Such a hypothetical kinase would need to be activated in a Cdc15dependent manner, because kinase-dead Cdc15 was unable to sustain activation of Dbf2-Mob1 (Fig. 3C). Another possibility is that the in vitro activation of Dbf2-Mob1 by Cdc15 is incomplete, and that Sid1 Cdc14 homologues or other factors (e.g., Sid4, Cdc11) may be required for optimal activation. This possibility is supported by quantitative considerations: the maximal kcat we observed for active Dbf2-Mob1 produced in our reconstituted this observation was based on histone H1 and not a physiological substrate, which remain unknown. WewishtostressthattheplacementofSid1upstreamofSid2was based on evaluating the localization of Sid2 in sid1 mutant strains, and not on direct biochemical analysis (36). In budding yeast, similarlogicwouldplaceCdc14upstreamofDbf2(32),eventhough it is well-accepted that Dbf2 is upstream of Cdc14 in the sense that it is required for the release of active Cdc14 from the nucleolus during anaphase. Interpreting the results of such experiments may be confounded by the operation of positive feedback loops within the MEN (37), so perhaps localization studies alone do not warrant placement of Sid1-Cdc14 upstream of Sid2. At first glance the MEN and SIN pathways regulate different processes: mitotic exit in budding yeast, and cytokinesis in fission yeast. However, various lines of evidence point to a role for the MEN in cytokinesis, including the prominent cell separation defect of net1-1 tem1 and net1-1 cdc15 strains (5, 38), and the relocalization of MEN components from the SPB to the bud neck during late anaphase (32, 39, 40). An intriguing hypothesis is that the mobilization of Cdc14 activity by the MEN helps ensure the sequential progression of mitotic exit and cytokinesis. Specifically, the liberated Cdc14 dephosphorylates and hyperactivates Cdc15 (37), which may serve to re-direct the activity of Cdc15 Mob1 Dbf2 from the spindle pole body to the cleavage furrow.
