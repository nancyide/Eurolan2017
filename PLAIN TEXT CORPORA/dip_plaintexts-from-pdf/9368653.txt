Nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2) is associated with the translocation stage of nuclear protein import and binds both to nuclear pore proteins (nucleoporins) containing phenylalanine-rich repeats and to the Ras family GTPase Ran. In this study we probed the role of the NTF2±Ran interaction in nuclear protein import using site-directed mutants of NTF2 that interfere with its interaction with GDP-Ran. The design of these mutants was based on the X-ray crystal structure of NTF2 and was concentrated on conserved residues in and around the molecule's hydrophobic cavity. The mutant NTF2 cDNAs were expressed in Escherichia coli. Puri®ed mutant proteins retained the interaction with FxFG-repeat nucleoporins, but several mutants in the negatively charged residues that surround the NTF2 cavity or in residues in the cavity itself were unable to bind GDP-Ran in vitro. The crystal structure of the E42K mutant protein showed signi®cant structural changes only in this side-chain, indicating that it participated directly in the interaction with GDP-Ran. In permeabilised cell nuclear protein import assays, only wild-type NTF2 and mutants that bound GDP-Ran were functional. Furthermore, when the NTF2 E42K and D92N/D94N NTF2 mutants that failed to bind GDPRan in vitro were substituted for the chromosomal yeast NTF2, the yeast cells became non-viable, whereas yeast substituted with wild-type human NTF2 remained viable. We conclude that interaction between NTF2 and GDP-Ran is important for ef®cient nuclear protein import. # 1997 Academic Press Limited

to the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), huge specialised macromolecular structures that perforate the nuclear envelope. Although both proteins and RNA are transported into and out of the nucleus, the process of nuclear protein import has been best characterised. Experiments that reconstitute protein import in permeabilised cells (Adam et al., 1990), combined with a variety of solution binding assays, have helped to delineate the mechanism of nuclear import (reviewed by GoÈrlich & Mattaj, 1996; PanteÂ & Aebi, 1996; Nigg, 1997; Corbett & Silver, 1997). Although small proteins, metabolites and ions can diffuse freely into the nucleus, most proteins and nucleic acids are imported actively in a signal-dependent mechan# 1997 Academic Press Limited

ism. Proteins containing a nuclear localisation sequence (NLS), which consists of one or two groups of positively charged residues (Dingwall & Laskey, 1991), are recognised by a cytoplasmic receptor, importin a (karyopherin a/SRP1/NLS receptor), which forms a heterodimer with importin b (karyopherin b/p97). The importin b subunit in turn targets this complex to the cytosolic periphery of the NPC (GoÈrlich et al., 1994, 1995; Moroianu et al., 1995). Translocation of the docked import substrate through the NPC and into the nuclear interior requires energy in the form of GTP and also at least two soluble factors, Ran and NTF2 (Moore & Blobel, 1993, 1994; Melchior et al., 1993; Paschal & Gerace, 1995; Weis et al., 1996; GoÈrlich et al., 1996). Ran is a 25 kDa GTPase of the Ras superfamily and cycles between GTP and GDP-bound states (Melchior et al., 1993; Moore & Blobel, 1993; Bischoff & Ponsting, 1991). The hydrolysis of GTP by Ran may provide the energy requirement for protein translocation. Various proteins regulate the Ran GTPase cycle including RCC1, a nuclear GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF), and RanGAP1, a GTPase activating protein (reviewed by Avis & Clarke, 1996; Koepp & Silver, 1996; Rush et al., 1996). Although RanGAP1 is dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, a major proportion of it is modi®ed by a ubiquitin-like molecule and is located on the cytoplasmic face of the NPC (Matunis et al., 1996; Mahajan et al., 1997). GDP-Ran is thought to predominate in the cytoplasm because of the presence of RanGAP1 (Hopper et al., 1990; Mahajan et al., 1997; Matunis et al., 1996), which generates GDP-Ran (Bischoff & Ponstingl, 1995), whereas RCC1, which regenerates GTP-Ran (Bischoff et al., 1991), is primarily nuclear (Ohtsubo et al., 1989). GTP-Ran can interact with importin b, and both GDP-Ran and GTP-Ran interact with components of the NPC. GTP-Ran binds directly to RanBP2/Nup358, a nucleoporin that forms part of the cytoplasmic ®bres, whereas GDP-Ran probably binds indirectly to the NPC (Weis et al., 1996; GoÈrlich et al., 1996). The precise molecular mechanism of protein translocation through NPCs into the nucleus is still unclear. Although many of the components and molecular interactions have been identi®ed (reviewed by GoÈrlich & Mattaj, 1996; Corbett & Silver, 1997; Stewart & Clarkson, 1996; PanteÂ & Aebi, 1996; Nigg, 1997), the order in which components act and their speci®c role in translocation remain to be established. However, a number of stages of the process have been characterised. The docked importin-substrate complex appears to commence translocation by interaction with Ran (Weis et al., 1996; GoÈrlich et al., 1996; Mahajan et al., 1997; Matunis et al., 1996). Translocation proceeds along the axis of the NPC (Feldherr et al., 1984) and ®nally importin b dissociates from importin asubstrate complex, which enters the nucleoplasm (Moroianu et al., 1996; GoÈrlich et al., 1996). The importins and Ran are thought to recycle to participate in further rounds of nuclear import. There are several different models (which are not necessarily mutually exclusive) for the mechanism by which Ran mediates nuclear protein import. Thus, Ran has been proposed to be involved in a single round of GTP hydrolysis, stimulated by RanGAP attached to RanBP2, which may serve as a commitment step to translocation (Melchior et al., 1995; Mahajan et al., 1997). Multiple Ran GTP-GDP cycles have been linked to the movement of the substrate±receptor complex through the NPC associated with the attachment and detachment of the complex to phenylalanine-repeat containing nucleoporins (Rexach & Blobel, 1995; Radu et al., 1995). It has also been proposed that the binding of GTP-Ran to importin b dissociates the a and b subunits at the nucleoplasmic face of the NPC (Moroianu et al., 1996; GoÈrlich et al., 1996) and facilitates release of the substrate. Finally, in in vitro transport assays, addition of GDP-Ran and not GTP-Ran produces nuclear protein import (Weis et al., 1996; GoÈrlich et al., 1996). The precise role of NTF2 in nuclear protein import is controversial. NTF2 was implicated in nuclear protein import by two groups using in vitro assays (Paschal & Gerace, 1995; Moore & Blobel, 1994), but other groups have not detected an in¯uence of NTF2 on import in similar assay systems (GoÈrlich et al., 1995; Chi et al., 1996). The Xenopus NTF2 homologue, alternatively known as p10, and Ran were identi®ed as the cytosolic components required to reconstitute translocation of docked import substrate (Moore & Blobel, 1993, 1994). In a parallel study, nucleoporin p62 bound to Sepharose was shown to deplete HeLa cytosol of import activity (Paschal & Gerace, 1995) and NTF2 was identi®ed as the cytoplasmic component required to complement p62-preabsorbed cytosol. Subsequent studies have shown that, in vitro, NTF2 binds directly to GDP-Ran, but not GTP-Ran, and to nucleoporins that contain repeats based on a phenylalanine-rich core (Paschal & Gerace, 1995; Clarkson et al., 1996; Nehrbass & Blobel, 1996; Paschal et al., 1996). The yeast NTF2 homologue is an essential protein (Corbett & Silver, 1996; Nehrbass & Blobel, 1996) and temperature-sensitive NTF2 mutants are defective in nuclear protein localisation (Corbett & Silver, 1996). Moreover, temperature-sensitive mutants of the yeast Ran homologue Gsp1 that show import defects can be rescued by overexpression of NTF2, indicating that an interaction between Ran and NTF2 is required for effective nuclear protein import in vivo (Wong et al., 1997). Overall these ®ndings implicate NTF2 in nuclear import, but it is less clear whether it is also required for nuclear export. In contrast to Ran and factors regulating Ran's GTPase cycle, yeast NTF2 mutants do not show a defect mRNA export (Corbett & Silver, 1996), although other work has implicated NTF2 in protein export from the nucleus (Tachibana et al., 1996).


718 NFT2±Ran Interaction in Nuclear Protein Import

Because of the central role of Ran in nuclear protein import, it is important to understand the role of its interactions with other components of the transport machinery. NTF2 is unique in binding to GDP-Ran and has been proposed to have a role in modulating the Ran-based interactions of the importin±substrate complex as it is translocated through the NPC (Nehrbass & Blobel, 1996). Moreover, reports that GDP- and not GTP-Ran must be added to produce transport in in vitro assays (GoÈrlich et al., 1996; Weis et al., 1996) make it important to understand the molecular interactions made by GDP-Ran. To begin a molecular dissection of these interactions, we have used protein engineering to produce a range of site-directed mutations designed using the NTF2 crystal structure (Bullock et al., 1996). The crystal structure showed that each NTF2 chain in the dimeric molecule had a pronounced hydrophobic cavity surrounded by a number of negatively charged residues. We report here that mutations of NTF2 around the cavity abolish the NTF2±Ran interaction, but leave the NTF2-nucleoporin interaction untouched, and hence identify the area on NTF2 to which GDP-Ran binds. NTF2 mutants that were defective in Ran binding were non-functional in vivo in yeast and, when tested in digitonin-permeabilised nuclear import assays, were unable to stimulate protein translocation into the nucleus. These results indicate that the NTF2±Ran interaction is an important component of ef®cient nuclear protein import. Results The interaction of GDP-Ran with NTF2 is more electrostatic in nature than that of nucleoporins with NTF2 NTF2 was originally identi®ed on the basis of its ability to interact with either Ran (Moore & Blobel, 1994) or nucleoporin p62 (Paschal & Gerace, 1995), and has subsequently been shown to interact with a range of yeast and mammalian FxFG repeat-containing nucleoporins (Clarkson et al., 1996; Hu et al., 1996; Nehrbass & Blobel, 1996). Moreover, NTF2Sepharose bead binding assays demonstrated that NTF2 has separate binding sites for Ran and the FxFG-repeats of p62 and Nsp1p (Clarkson et al., 1996). However, before constructing mutants, we ®rst investigated whether the interactions were electrostatic, and as a result potentially mediated by charged residues, or more hydrophobic in nature. Electrostatic, but not hydrophobic, interactions are susceptible to competition by high salt conditions, which do not favour the formation of hydrogen bonds. The interactions of NTF2 with GDP-Ran and nucleoporins show different sensitivities to ionic strength. NTF2-Sepharose beads were incubated with the repeat region of either nucleoporin Nsp1p or GDP-Ran, and the beads were washed with buffers of increasing salt concentration. The

Figure 1. Effect of salt on the NTF2-Nsp1p and NTF2± Ran interactions. Effect of increasing concentrations of NaCl in the wash buffer on the binding of nucleoporin Nsp1 repeat (a), and Ran (b) to NTF2. A 100 mg sample of Nsp1 repeats (Nsp1p-18R), or Ran, was incubated for one hour at 4C with 50 ml of NTF2-Sepharose beads in 50 mM imidazole-HCl buffer (pH 7.0). The beads were then washed in 50 mM imidazole-HCl buffer containing different concentrations of salt. Lanes 1 to 6 correspond to washes with 0 mM, 50 mM, 100 mM, 150 mM, 400 mM and 800 mM NaCl, respectively. Lane 7 of (a) shows that Nsp1p-18R does not bind BSA control beads washed with 0 mM salt. In contrast to Ran, Nsp1p-18R is not dissociated from the beads by high concentrations of salt. (Note that because NTF2 is dimeric, one chain of each molecule was generally released in SDS-PAGE and so gave rise to the strong NTF2 band in each lane.)

washed pellets were examined by SDS±PAGE and, as shown in Figure 1, the strength of the interaction between NTF2 and GDP-Ran decreased as the ionic strength of the wash solution increased, whereas the NTF2-nucleoporin interaction did not. This result indicated that the interaction of NTF2 with GDP-Ran had a larger electrostatic component that the NTF2±Nsp1p

interaction. A more hydrophobic nature of the NTF2-nucleoporin interaction is consistent with the ®nding that the phenylalanine-rich regions of the repeats probably mediate the interaction (Clarkson et al., 1996). NTF2 mutants We used protein engineering to construct a range of NTF2 mutants, designed on the basis of the crystal structure of the molecule, that could be used to establish features of NTF2 important for its function. The crystal structure of NTF2 (Bullock et al., 1996) indicated some striking features of the molecule. Each polypeptide chain in the dimeric molecule has a distinctive hydrophobic cavity, the entrance to which is surrounded by a cluster of negatively charged residues (Bullock et al., 1996). Because the regions in Ran that change conformation in response to the state of the bound nucleotide (Scheffzek et al., 1995) are markedly more positively charged than in other members of the Ras superfamily, it has been proposed that the interaction between GDP-Ran and NTF2 might involve complementation of these positively charged residues on Ran by the negatively charged cluster surrounding the NTF2 cavity (Bullock et al., 1996). Such a suggestion would be consistent with this interaction having a substantial electrostatic component (Figure 1), and so we targeted these negatively charged residues for mutagenesis. We also changed several other residues that were highly conserved, exposed on the surface of the molecule, and which had side-chains with the potential to form hydrogen bonds. In addition, two truncation mutants were engineered in which the C-terminal two (F126Á) and four (H124Á) residues had been deleted. Table 1 summarizes the mutants constructed while Figure 2a shows the locations of mutated residues in the rat NTF2 sequence and the equivalent residues in yeast NTF2. The location of these residues on the surface of rat NTF2, surrounding the cavity, is shown in Figure 2b and c. NTF2 mutants have altered protein interactions in vitro NTF2 mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli, puri®ed and coupled to CNBr-Sepharose in an Table 1.

identical manner to wild-type NTF2. Gel ®ltration con®rmed that, like the wild-type protein, all the mutants were dimeric (data not shown). When the mutant proteins were incubated with bacterially expressed p62 or Nsp1p, washed, and the bound fractions examined by SDS-PAGE, all the mutant NTF2 proteins bound nucleoporins at roughly wild-type levels (Figure 3(a) and (b)). By contrast, in the equivalent experiment with GDP-Ran, the amount of GDP-Ran bound by most mutant NTF2 proteins was distinctly lower than that bound by wild-type NTF2 (Figure 3(c)). In particular, NTF2 mutants E42K (lane 2), D92/94N (lane 3), H66A (lane 4) and H124Á (lane 7), bound practically no GDP-Ran, and certainly no more than the amount of GDP-Ran that was bound by BSA control beads (lane 9). The mutants D117N (lane 5) and F126Á (lane 8) showed intermediate levels of Ran binding, and D23N (lane 6) exhibited almost wild-type (lane 1) levels of Ran binding. Essentially the same results were also obtained when NTF2 was co-incubated with both GDP-Ran and Nsp1p (Figure 3(d)), consistent with GDP-Ran and nucleoporins binding independently to distinct sites on NTF2 (Clarkson et al., 1996). Although there was some variation in the amount of nucleoporin bound to the different NTF2 mutants, the variation was small compared to that seen with GDP-Ran and, overall, these results, taken in conjunction with two-hybrid assays (see Figure 8), indicated that nucleoporin binding was retained by all mutant constructs. It was important to establish that the effects identi®ed in the solution binding assay were not due to misfolding of NTF2 created by the mutation. We considered it unlikely that the NTF2 mutants were grossly misfolded because, like the wild-type protein, they were dimeric by gel ®ltration and still bound nucleoporins, suggesting that the dimer interface and the nucleoporin interface remained correctly folded. However, it was conceivable that other regions of the protein were considerably altered by the introduction of mutated residues. To resolve this issue conclusively, we established the three-dimensional structures of the E42K and H66A mutants using X-ray crystallography. In the E42K mutant, the carbon backbones were superimposable with the wildtype structure with a rms deviation of 0.16 A and Ê there were no systematic variations between the native and mutant structures except at the mutated side-chain itself (Figures 4 and 5). Therefore, because it was the only signi®cant change introduced into the structure, one can be con®dent that the side-chain of Glu42 probably interacts directly with GDP-Ran. However, the H66A mutation introduced much more complex structural changes. As shown in Figure 5, this point mutation introduced structural changes at some distance from His66. There were changes in both the main-chain and side-chain positions in the region of residues 20 to 30, 55 to 68 and 88 to 95. Some of these changes may have come about because, in NTF2,

His66 forms a salt bridge with Asp23 (Bullock et al., 1996), which may have a role in maintaining the fold of the polypeptide chain. It may be signi®cant that one of the areas in which the structure is altered in the H66A mutant is in the loop containing Asp92 and Asp94. As our mutagenesis studies (Figure 3) indicated that these two residues appear to be important for the NTF2±Ran interaction, it may be that H66A reduces the NTF2±Ran interaction by its effect on this region of the molecule. Because of the complex nature of the structural changes introduced by the H66A mutation, one cannot safely conclude on the basis of these data alone that there is a direct interaction between His66 and GDP-Ran and clearly more extensive studies, such as establishing the structure of the interaction interface between the molecules by X-ray crystallography, will be necessary to resolve the precise contribution of His66 to the interaction. Unfortunately we have not produced crystals of D92/94N suitable for X-ray crystallographic analysis, and so the structural changes introduced by this mutation are not known with the precision of E42K. Some NTF2 mutants cannot stimulate nuclear protein import in vitro Digitonin-permeabilised cell assays (Moore & Blobel, 1994; Paschal et al., 1996) have indicated that NTF2 stimulates translocation of a ¯uorescently labelled NLS substrate in the presence of the importins and Ran. We therefore investigated

Aspartate 23 (the D23N mutation) is not visible in this view, the residue being located towards the back of the protein. Residues 126 and 127 were not identi®able in the crystal structure of this NTF2 chain, and so the F126Á truncation is not shown. (c) Schematic model of the NTF2 cavity and surrounding surface showing the key residues facing from the cavity, and the mutations introduced. whether the NTF2 mutants were also capable of stimulating nuclear protein import. Wild-type and mutant NTF2 were incubated in digitonin-permeabilised nuclear protein import assays alongside HeLa cytosol that had been depleted of endogenous NTF2 by pre-incubation with p62-Sepharose (Paschal & Gerace, 1995). In these assays, the mutants E42K and D92/94N showed virtually no stimulation of the import of the ¯uorescently labelled NLS-substrate into the nucleus, even at the high concentration of 25 mg/ml (Figure 6), whereas although H66A and H124Á were able to stimulate import, their stimulatory effect was small compared with wild-type NTF2. At the same concentration, D117N and F126Á were able to stimulate protein import more effectively and approached levels seen with the wild-type protein. Therefore the Ran-binding activity of the mutant NTF2 proteins in the solution binding assay (Figure 3) paralleled their respective activities in nuclear protein import, clearly indicating that the NTF2±Ran interaction is critical for ef®cient nuclear protein import and that a diminution of this interaction resulted in a corresponding reduction in import activity. To ensure that these results were not dependent on the saturating concentrations of NTF2 employed, the same experiments were repeated at a range of NTF2 concentrations for wild-type NTF2, E42K and D117N (Figure 7). Wild-type NTF2 was able to maximally stimulate nuclear import at concentrations above 5 mg/ml. By contrast, NTF2 E42K was unable to stimulate nuclear protein import at any of the concentrations tested, and although

Figure 3. Interaction of NTF2 mutants with nucleoporins and GDP-Ran in solution binding assays. (a) p62 binds to all NTF2 mutants. The puri®ed NTF2 mutants were coupled to CNBr-Sepharose beads which were then mixed with aliquots of p62. After one hour of incubation, the beads were pelleted, washed, and examined by SDS±PAGE. Although low levels of p62 bound to control BSA-Sepharose (lane 9), signi®cantly greater amounts of p62 bound to all of the NTF2-Sepharose samples (lanes 1 to 8). (b) Nsp1p-18R binds to all the NTF2 mutants. Aliquots of the various NTF2 mutants were incubated with the FxFG repeat region of the yeast nucleoporin Nsp1p (Nsp1p-18R; see Clarkson et al., 1996), and after washing, the bead pellets were examined by SDS-PAGE. Again all the NTF2 mutants bound the nucleoporin (lanes 2 to 8), whereas negligible quantities of Nsp1p-18R remained bound to control BSASepharose beads. (c) GDP-Ran binds selectively to some NTF2 mutants but not to others. Aliquots of the NTF2 mutants were incubated with GDP-Ran and the bound fraction examined by SDS-PAGE. As observed previously, wild-type NTF2 bound GDP-Ran (lane 1), whereas very much lower levels of GDP-Ran were bound to control BSA beads (lane 9). However, the ability of the NTF2 mutants to bind GDP-Ran in this assay varied: E42K (lane 2), D92/ 94N (lane 3), H66A (lane 4), H124Á (lane 7) only bound GDP-Ran to effectually the same level as the control BSASepharose beads, whereas D117N (lane 5), D23N (lane 6) and F126Á (lane 8) bound a greater amount of GDP-Ran, but clearly less than wild-type NTF2. (d) The presence of nucleoporin does not effect the binding of GDP-Ran by wild-type NTF2 and the engineered mutants. The experiments shown in (b) and (c) were repeated in the presence of both GDP-Ran and Nsp1p-18R, but the results were essentially the same as when the NTF2 mutants were incubated with either protein separately: all mutants bound the nucleoporin repeats, but, except for D23N, did not bind GDPRan, or bound it at reduced levels.

NTF2 D117N stimulated protein import to roughly wild-type levels at 25 mg/ml, at concentrations below 25 mg/ml the difference was more marked, indicating that the protein functions less ef®ciently than the wild-type protein. In summary, in vitro transport assays using digitonin-permeabilized cells indicated that NTF2 mutants that do not bind GDP-Ran also fail to stimulate nuclear protein import. We concentrated on the E42K and D92/94N mutants for further study in vivo, because of their dramatic effect on the GDP-Ran±NTF2 interaction in in vitro binding and transport assays and also, in the case of E42K, because the nature of the change introduced had been established with con®dence by X-ray crystallography. Analysis of Ran±NTF2 interactions using two hybrid assays To examine the interaction of NTF2 mutants with Ran in vivo, we took advantage of the twohybrid/interaction trap methodology (Golemis et al., 1994; Fields & Sternglanz, 1994). This assay relies on the ability of the two interacting proteins to tether the DNA-binding and transcriptional activation domains of a transcription factor (LexA was used in this case). Only when the two domains (DNA-binding and transcriptional activation) are in close proximity to one another are reporter genes (b-galactosidase and LEU2) transcribed (Golemis et al., 1994). Thus, a positive interaction can be scored either using units of b-galactosidase

The E42K mutant only deviated signi®cantly at residue 42, whereas H66A has more global changes, especially in the regions of residues 20 to 30, 55 to 68 and 90 to 95. Thus E42K showed only negligible changes in backbone Ca positions (rms  0.16 A) which were at the noise level of the structure determination, Ê whereas there were substantial changes in Ca position in three regions of H66A. Because their atomic structure had been altered, it was not possible to compare the side-chain deviation at the mutated residue (42 and 66, respectively) and so it is given as zero. In the case of E42K, there were only minor changes in the other side-chains, the largest being at Ile10, which resulted from rotation of a single atom (Cd about the Cb±Cg bond; this change was not

observed in the other chain of the NTF2 dimer). By contrast, there were larger changes in the H66A side-chains, especially in the regions where changes were observed in the Ca backbone.

The E42K, D92/ 94N, H66A and H124Á NTF2 mutants that showed negligible GDP-Ran binding in solution binding assays also failed to stimulate nuclear protein import, whereas D117N and F126Á, which showed partial but not complete loss of GDP-Ran binding, showed intermediate levels of stimulation. Overall, therefore, the stimulatory activity of the mutants paralleled their af®nity for GDPRan. All assays were performed in triplicate and had standard deviations of less than 5%.

Wild-type and NTF2 mutants were cloned into the pEG202 vector C-terminal to the LexA DNA binding domain and these plasmids were introduced into the MATa strain EGY48. The MATa EGY42 strain was transformed with pJG4-5 plasmids encoding either Ran or a variety of nucleoporins and nucleoporin domains (Stutz et al., 1996). Western blotting of HA-tagged constructs indicated that the mutant NTF2 proteins had comparable stability in vivo to that observed for wildtype NTF2 and were expressed at comparable levels. The two yeast strains were mated to one another and diploids selected. The diploids (now containing both the pEG202 and the pJG4-5 plasmids) were analyzed initially by their ability to grow on leucine. Interactions were then quanti®ed by using a standard b-galactosidase activity assay (Kaiser et al., 1994). The in vivo interactions between Ran and NTF2 detected by the two-hybrid system paralleled those observed using biochemical methods. Wild-type NTF2 interacted strongly with either Ran or with Nsp1 (Figure 8(a)). The same result was obtained for the D117N mutant, which bound Ran at intermediate levels in in vitro assays. In contrast, although the E42K and D92/94N mutants were able to bind Nsp1 at levels approximately equal to wild-type, neither was able to interact with Ran in vivo. When yeast cells containing wild-type NTF2 or the mutant constructs were mated with yeast containing Ran, or the yeast homologues Gsp1p and Gsp2p, interaction was only detected with wild-type NTF2; both NTF2 mutants tested, E42K and D92/94N (Figure 8(b)), failed to show signi®cant interaction in this assay. Neither wildtype nor mutant NTF2 constructs interacted with the control GTPase, Ras (Figure 8(b)). To examine the role that interactions with various nucleoporins might play in NTF2 function, we examined the interaction of wild-type NTF2 with a variety of nucleoporins (Figure 8(c) and (d)). Wildtype and both mutant NTF2s interacted with constructs containing the repeat regions of Nsp1p, Nup1p and Nup2p (Stutz et al., 1996), all of which are yeast FxFG-repeat-containing nucleoporins (Figures 8(c) and (d)). In the same assay NTF2 did not interact with the GLFG-repeat nucleoporins Nup100p and Nup116p. Therefore, these results indicate that NTF2 binds generally to FxFG nucleoporins, and, as in the Sepharose bead assay, the E42K and D92/94N mutations did not affect this interaction (Figure 8(d)). Overall, the results obtained from living yeast cells using the two-hybrid assay were completely consistent with those obtained from in vitro binding assays and indicated that the E42K and D92/ 94N mutants retained the ability to bind to FxFG nucleoporin repeats but did not interact with Ran. The E42K and D92/94N NTF2 mutants cannot functionally replace the wild-type yeast NTF2 gene In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the NTF2 gene is essential for viability (Corbett & Silver, 1996; Nehrbass & Blobel, 1996). Therefore, to complement the in vitro analysis and two-hybrid study of the NTF2 mutants, we examined the ability of the mutant genes to substitute for the endogenous NTF2 gene in S. cerevisiae. Previous work has shown that the human NTF2 open read-

ing frame can substitute for the yeast NTF2 open reading frame (Corbett & Silver, 1996). Therefore, we could examine whether the mutants generated in this study could function in vivo by exchanging them for wild-type NTF2 in yeast. Mutant constructs on LEU2 plasmids were transformed into a ÁNTF2 haploid strain maintained by a URA3 yeast NTF2 plasmid. Transformants were then selected and streaked to 5H-¯uoroorotic acid to expel the URA3 plasmid (Boeke et al., 1987). As demonstrated previously, strains containing either the wild-type yeast NTF2 gene or the corresponding human cDNA in the context of the yeast ¯anking sequence were viable (Figure 9). The strain-containing vector alone was inviable. The D117N mutant had wild-type viability: its growth was indistinguishable from that of wild-type cells at all temperatures examined and we did not observe any defects in nuclear protein import nor poly(A) RNA export (data not shown). In contrast to the D117N mutant, neither the E42K nor the D92/94N mutant was able to support growth when they were the sole copies of NTF2 present in the yeast. Neither of these mutants was a dominant negative, since the mutant plasmids were recessive to the wild-type NTF2 plasmid when both were present.

(c) and (d) Interactions between wild-type NTF2 and a range of nucleoporins as indicated. In (c) bgalactosidase assays show NTF2 interacts with FxFG nucleoporins such as Nsp1, Nup1 and Nup2, but not with nucleoporins containing FG repeats such as Nup100, Nup116, Rip1 or Yrb2 (called Nup36 by Nehrbass & Blobel, 1996). The same spectrum of interactions was seen with E42K and D92/94N mutants on selective media (d). These ®ndings parallel the in vitro binding and activity assays: mutants that were defective in Ran binding in vitro could not maintain viability in S. cerevisiae in vivo. Because yeast expressing only the mutant E42K or D92/94N construct were not viable, it was not possible to show directly that these mutants disrupted nuclear protein import in vivo. However, the analogous temperature-sensitive yeast NTF2 mutant D91G shows distinctive abnormalities in nuclear protein import (Corbett & Silver, 1996). To demonstrate that results obtained with mutant human NTF2 proteins expressed in yeast are relevant to the function of the endogenous yeast NTF2 protein, mutants were generated both in the human NTF2 cDNA and in the corresponding residues of the S. cerevisiae gene (data not shown). Identical results were obtained regardless of whether the mutant protein was derived from the yeast or the human gene.

Discussion We have used protein engineering based on the atomic structure of NTF2 (Bullock et al., 1996) to produce several NTF2 mutants in which GDP-Ran

Figure 9. In vivo analysis of the function of mutant NTF2 proteins. Plasmids encoding mutant versions of NTF2 were transformed into the NTF2 deletion strain (PSY852) covered by a URA3 plasmid (pPS883) encoding wild-type yeast NTF2 (Corbett & Sliver, 1996). The leucine plate illustrates that none of the mutant forms of NTF2 are dominant negative in nature. Strains maintained by a wild-type copy of NTF2 are perfectly viable in the presence of these mutant proteins. The FOA plate demonstrates that when the wild-type NTF2 gene is eliminated from the strains only the plasmid encoding the D117N mutant is able to support viability. Neither the E42K mutant protein nor the D92/94N protein can function in vivo. Controls with either the vector alone and restoration of growth by the wild-type NTF2 plasmid are also shown. Experiments were performed with both yeast and rat (shown here) versions of the mutant cDNA and the results obtained were indistinguishable.

binding is eliminated while binding to FxFG nucleoporin repeats is retained as assessed by both in vitro binding studies and yeast two-hybrid analysis (Table 1 and Figures 3 and 8). Mutants defective in GDP-Ran binding were unable to stimulate nuclear import (Figures 6 and 7). Moreover, the E42K mutant that X-ray crystallography showed had changed only in the structure of the mutated side-chain (Figures 4 and 5) was not viable when exchanged for wild-type NTF2 in yeast (Figure 9). Overall these results indicate the importance of the NTF2±Ran interaction during protein transport into the nucleus. Binding of GDP-Ran to NTF2 The fold of the NTF2 polypeptide chain is that of an a/b barrel in which a long N-terminal a-helix folds across a distinctly bent b-sheet to produce a cone-like structure (Bullock et al., 1996). The major faces of the bent sheet pack together to form the dimer interface. The b-sheets lie closest to the main a-helix at its extreme N terminus, and fan out to

create a cone-shaped structure with a distinct opening at the far end that results in each NTF2 chain having a pronounced hydrophobic cavity (Figure 2(b)). The entrance to this cavity is surrounded by a group of highly conserved negatively charged residues predominantly located in the surface loops between b strands. Inspection of the atomic structure of NTF2 using computer graphics indicated that, in general, these residues do not appear to play an important role in either the fold of the NTF2 polypeptide chain or its dimerization. The results described here indicate, however, that these residues have a critical role in the interaction between NTF2 and GDP-Ran. The mutations D92/94N and E42K abolished Ran-binding to NTF2 (Figure 3). Mutations within the cavity (e.g. H66A, D117N) can also reduce Ran-binding to NTF2, although it may be that these effects are indirect and alter Ran binding by producing more extensive changes in the structure of NTF2 than the E42K mutant (Figure 5). The cavity has been proposed to be the site of a putative but unidenti®ed enzymatic activity of NTF2 (Bullock et al., 1996), and so it is tempting to speculate that NTF2 may have a wider role than binding to GDP-Ran. For example, NTF2 has been proposed to regulate the formation of GTP-Ran in the presence of importins and other factors (Nehrbass & Blobel, 1996). Alternatively, substrate bound in the hydrophobic cavity of NTF2 could inhibit its binding to GDP-Ran. Two temperature-sensitive mutations have been created in yeast NTF2 by random mutagenesis (Corbett & Silver, 1996) and one of these has Asp91, equivalent to human D92, mutated to glycine. In human NTF2, mutation of D92N and D94N together eliminated the interaction with GDP-Ran and was not viable in yeast, whereas D91G was viable at the permissive temperature. The temperature sensitivity of the D91G mutation identi®ed in the yeast screen may re¯ect a partial rather than total disruption of Ran binding that is intensi®ed at the non-permissive temperature. Because the yeast D91G mutant is viable at the permissive temperature, it seems likely that this mutation has reduced the thermal stability of the molecule rather than eliminated its interaction with Ran entirely. Such a decrease in stability would be consistent with the rather strained conformation observed in this loop in the crystal structure (Bullock et al., 1996). Signi®cantly, twohybrid assays could not detect an interaction between the yeast D91G NTF2 and the yeast Ran homologue Gsp1 at the non-permissive temperature (Wong et al., 1997), which, taken together with the observation that temperature-sensitive Gsp1 mutants could be rescued by overexpression of NTF2 (Wong et al., 1997), strongly supports the conclusion that an interaction between NTF2 and Ran is crucial for ef®cient nuclear protein import in vivo. The results obtained with C-terminal truncation mutants indicated that, although residues Phe126


726 NFT2±Ran Interaction in Nuclear Protein Import

and Gly127 appeared to have little in¯uence on the interaction of NTF2 with GDP-Ran, deletion of Asn125 and His124 ablated binding. In the crystal structure of NTF2 (Bullock et al., 1996) residues 126 and 127 are poorly ordered and, in one chain, are completely disordered. Consequently, it is unlikely that they are important for the correct folding or dimerization of NTF2. Moreover, these residues are not conserved between human and yeast NTF2 (Figure 2). However, it would appear that at least His124 or Asn125 have a role in the interaction of NTF2 with GDP-Ran, which suggests that it may not be wise to employ constructs to which C-terminal tags have been attached. The identi®cation of residues on NTF2 involved in the GDP±Ran interaction has wider implications for Ran binding sites on other proteins. The decrease in the amount of GDP-Ran bound to NTF2-Sepharose with increasing ionic strength (Figure 1) indicated that the NTF2±Ran interaction has a substantial electrostatic component and was consistent with our observation that mutations in several key charged residues eliminated the GDPRan±NTF2 interaction. High-resolution X-ray crystallography studies of Ras bound to either GDP or GTP analogues has indicated that two regions of the polypeptide change their conformation markedly between GDP and GTP-bound states. These regions in Ras are termed switch I/effector and switch II and changes in their conformation are thought to be linked directly to the functional interactions made by Ras in signalling pathways (see Wittinghofer & Pai, 1991; Stouten et al., 1993). Ran has analogous switch I and switch II loops whose conformation is thought to change markedly between the GTP and GDP-bound states (Scheffzek et al., 1995). Moreover, the switch I and II regions in Ran have comparatively more positively charged and fewer negatively charged residues than the corresponding Ras sequence (see Scheffzek et al., 1995). The majority of the mutated residues (in particular D92, D94 and E42) in NTF2 that decreased the interaction between NTF2 and GDP-Ran were negatively charged. Consequently, complementation of these charged regions at the interaction interface may explain both the nucleotide speci®city of the GDP-Ran-NTF2 interaction and also the inability of NTF2 to interact with other GTPases, such as Ras in the two-hybrid assay (Figure 8). In this context it is interesting to note the effect of charged residues on Ras/Rap effector speci®city (see Nassar et al., 1996). Also, the identi®cation of a largely negatively charged Ran-binding site on NTF2 formed from several surface loops of the protein, is consistent with recent suggestions that Ran-binding sites on importin b, RanBP1 and Nup358/RanBP2 may also be formed by predominantly negatively charged regions located in surface loops (Enenkel et al., 1996; Moroianu et al., 1996). Interaction of NTF2 with nucleoporins containing phenylalanine-rich repeats In contrast to the large variation in GDP-Ran binding observed with some mutant NTF2 constructs, there was much less variation in the levels of FxFG nucleoporins bound (Figure 3). Although in bead-binding assays E42K bound slightly less Nsp1p than wild-type NTF2, D92/94N bound slightly more of this nucleoporin than the wildtype protein. Moreover, in the two-hybrid assay, E42K and D92/94N showed essentially the same Nsp1p-binding activity as wild-type NTF2 (Figure 8(a)). Therefore, we concluded that whereas some mutants had produced a dramatic decrease in GDP-Ran binding, FxFG nucleoporin binding was retained in all cases. There are two major, but overlapping, subclasses of repeat-containing nucleoporins (reviewed by Rout & Wente, 1994): GLFG-repeat nucleoporins (including mammalian Nup97 and yeast Nup145p, Nup116p, Nup100p, Nup57p and Nup49p); and FxFG-repeat nucleoporins (e.g. mammalian p62; yeast Nsp1p, Nup1p, Nup2p). NTF2 had been shown to bind to members of the p62 complex and Nsp1p in Sepharose bead assays (Clarkson et al., 1996; Paschal & Gerace, 1995; Hu et al., 1996). In addition NTF2 bound Nup1p, Nsp1p, Nup145, Nup57p, Nup49p and Yrb2p (called Nup36) in blot overlays (Nehrbass & Blobel, 1996). In general these are mainly FxFG-nucleoporins, and indeed the isolated FxFG-repeat region of Nsp1p is able to bind NTF2 (Clarkson et al., 1996). To complement these studies and to probe further the nature of the interaction between NTF2 and phenylalanine-repeat nucleoporins, we used a yeast two-hybrid assay to test a range of nucleoporins of each class. The FxFG repeat regions of Nsp1p, Nup1p and Nup2p all interacted strongly with NTF2 in our two-hybrid assay, whereas no interaction was detected with the GLFG repeat regions of Nup116p or Nup100p (Figure 8(b)). This result indicated that NTF2 interacts generally with FxFG repeats. The extent of its interaction with GLFG repeats is less clear. The GLFG repeat proteins Nup116p and Nup100p that we tested by the two hybrid assay did not interact with NTF2, consistent with blot overlay assays (Nehrbass & Blobel, 1996). However, blot overlays have indicated an interaction between NTF2 and an N-terminal GLFG Nup145 fragment as well as Nup57p and Nup49p, and so it remains possible that NTF2 binds to some GLFG-proteins and not others. The nucleoporin-binding site on NTF2 is distinct from the Ran-binding site (Clarkson et al., 1996), and therefore it is not unexpected that NTF2 mutations that affected Ran binding did not affect nucleoporin binding as detected by either a Sepharose-bead assay or two-hybrid assay. Ran±NTF2 interaction in nuclear protein import The role of NTF2 in nuclear protein import has been controversial. Although NTF2 was originally

identi®ed as a soluble factor involved in import by groups using in vitro permeabilized cell transport assays (Moore & Blobel, 1994; Paschal & Gerace, 1995), other groups (GoÈrlich et al., 1995; Chi et al., 1996) have not found NTF2 essential for transport in analogous systems. In these assay systems, depletion of cytosol of NTF2 does not completely eliminate nuclear protein import (see Figures 6 and 7), and so its role could be to stimulate transport rather than to be essential for transport. Alternatively, the permeabilized cell assay is necessarily crude and it could be that NTF2 has not always been removed by washing or that the methods used to assess transport have not been able to detect quantitative differences in the rate of nuclear protein import. In the experiments reported here there was not only a stimulation of the rate of import when NTF2 was added, but this stimulation was not found when mutants unable to bind GDP-Ran were employed, indicating the importance of this interaction for nuclear protein import in vitro. More signi®cant, however, is the role of NTF2 in nuclear protein import in vivo. Previous studies have shown that NTF2 is essential in yeast (Nehrbass & Blobel, 1996; Corbett & Silver, 1996) and that, at the non-permissive temperature, NTF2 temperature-sensitive alleles show clear abnormalities in nuclear protein import (Corbett & Silver, 1996). Moreover, over-expression of NTF2 can rescue temperature-sensitive alleles of the yeast Ran homologue Gsp1 (Wong et al., 1997). Here we have used a two-hybrid system to demonstrate that NTF2 interacts with Ran and Gsp1 in yeast in vivo (Figure 8) and moreover that NTF2 mutants that do not bind GDP-Ran in vitro and do not stimulate nuclear protein import in permeabilized cells are not viable in yeast in the absence of the wild-type NTF2 allele. Taken together, therefore, these results not only underscore the importance of NTF2 in nuclear protein import but also identify its interaction with Ran as key component of the transport mechanism. In conclusion, we have used protein engineering to construct a range of mutant NTF2 proteins that bind FxFG nucleoporin repeats indistinguishably from wild-type NTF2 but in which the interaction with GDP-Ran is undetectable. These mutants, most notably E42K, do not stimulate nuclear protein import in vitro and are unable to replace wildtype NTF2 in yeast. Overall these results indicate a crucial role for the interaction between NTF2 and GDP-Ran in nuclear protein import. Materials and Methods NTF2 mutants Amino acid substitutions in the sequence of rat NTF2 were introduced by PCR mutagenesis (Barik, 1993) of the corresponding cDNA (Kent et al., 1996). Oligonucleotide primers were synthesised to encode the altered amino acid sequence, and occasionally other silent base changes to aid recognition of the mutated product by restriction mapping. In the case of the truncation mutants (F126Á and H124Á), the primer was used directly with a forward PCR primer to amplify the mutated product. Point mutants were made by a twophase strategy. In the ®rst round of ampli®cation, a pET15b reverse primer was used in combination with the mutated NTF2 primer to amplify the 3H-end of the NTF2 cDNA from wild-type NTF2 in pET15b (Kent et al., 1996). The ampli®ed product was visualised by gel electrophoresis, and the DNA fragment excised and gel puri®ed using the Geneclean II kit (Bio 101, La Jolla, CA). In the second round of PCR ampli®cation, a NTF2 forward primer matching the 5H-end of the NTF2 gene was used in combination with the puri®ed product from the ®rst round. Ef®cient ampli®cation of the ®nal full-length mutated NTF2 gene required almost all the puri®ed product to be used in the second round to ensure that the molar concentration of this megaprimer was suf®cient to make enough ampli®ed product (Barik, 1993). The presence of two very unevenly matched primers meant optimum reaction conditions had to be determined in each case to ensure production of product. The PCR reaction was analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the product was excised and gel puri®ed as before. The puri®ed DNA was cloned into pTAG using the LigATor kit (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN), sequenced and then subcloned into pET15b. NTF2 mutants were expressed and puri®ed as described for wild-type NTF2 (Kent et al., 1996), and coupled to CNBr-Sepharose (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) beads following the manufacturer's recommended protocol, as described (Bullock et al., 1996; Clarkson et al., 1996). Solution binding assays Sepharose bead binding assays were conducted as described (Clarkson et al., 1996). Brie¯y, 50 ml aliquots of NTF2-coupled or control BSA-coupled Sepharose bead slurry were incubated on a turntable for one hour at 4C with 100 mg of Ran and/or 100 mg of Nsp1p repeats or p62 in a total volume of 1 ml of 50 mM imidazole-HCl (pH 7.0). Ran, p62 and the repeat domain of Nsp1p containing 18 FxFG repeats were all obtained by expression in E. coli, and puri®ed as described (Buss & Stewart, 1995; Clarkson et al., 1996). The beads were then pelleted and washed three or four times in 1 ml of the same buffer (or high salt buffers, see Figure 1 legend). The ®nal bead pellet was solubilised in SDS sample buffer and examined by SDS-PAGE. (Note that, although NTF2 molecules were covalently coupled to the Sepharose beads, because it is a dimer one of the subunits dissociated into the sample buffer and was readily made visible by SDS-PAGE (Clarkson et al., 1996).) In vitro nuclear import assays The activities of wild-type and mutant NTF2 proteins were measured in a nuclear protein import assay that features digitonin-permeabilised HeLa cells and quanti®cation by ¯ow cytometry (Paschal & Gerace, 1995). Recombinant NTF2 proteins were serially diluted from 0.5 mg/ml glycerol stocks (stored at À80C) in transport buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 110 mM potassium acetate, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 0.5 mM EGTA) containing 2 mM DTT and 1.0 mg/ml BSA as a carrier protein. Recombinant NTF2 proteins were tested at the concentrations indicated in the legends to Figures 6 and 7 in the

presence of HeLa cytosol ($2 mg/ml) depleted of NTF2 by preadsorption with p62-Sepharose (Paschal & Gerace, 1995). We also tested wild-type and mutant NTF2 proteins in a background of cytosol depleted of NTF2 protein by gel ®ltration chromatography. This involved fractionating HeLa cell cytosol on a S100 column in transport buffer containing 2 mM DTT at a ¯ow rate of 15 ml/h at 4C. The eluted fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting using an antibody to NTF2 (Paschal & Gerace, 1995). Fractions devoid of NTF2 were pooled, precipitated with ammonium sulphate (55% ®nal concentration), and dialysed into transport buffer containing 2 mM DTT. Assays that included the S100 fractionated cytosol were supplemented with 6 mg/ml bacterially expressed Ran/TC4, since this protein was also removed by the S100 fractionation procedure. The ability of wildtype NTF2 to stimulate transport in p62-treated cytosol, or in cytosol prepared by S100 chromatography, varied from 1.5 to 3.5-fold in different experiments, and was probably related to the extent of digitonin permeabilization and the ef®ciency with which transport factors were released from the cells. Therefore, all results obtained with the mutant NTF2 proteins were normalized to the values obtained with wild-type NTF2 in the same preparation of permeabilized cells. Introduction of mutant NTF2 into S. cerevisiae In vivo analyses of the mutant NTF2 proteins took advantage of plasmids encoding either the endogenous yeast NTF2 gene or the human NTF2 gene ¯anked by the yeast 5H and 3H untranslated regions on centromeric LEU plasmids (Corbett & Silver, 1996). E42K, D117N and D92/94N mutations (or the yeast equivalents) were generated in both constructs using the QuikChange2 Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene. Mutant plasmids were sequenced to con®rm that only the mutation of interest was created. To test in vivo function, these plasmids were transformed into a yeast strain lacking the essential NTF2 coding region (Corbett & Silver, 1996) by plasmid shuf¯e. Viability was determined by examining growth on 5H-¯uoroorotic acid (FOA). In each case both the human mutant and the corresponding yeast mutant were examined. As controls, the vector alone and the wild-type NTF2 gene were examined for each experiment. Two-hybrid analysis Two-hybrid/interaction trap constructs were generated by cloning the appropriate genes into either the LexA binding domain plasmid, pEG202, or the acid-blob transcriptional activator plasmid pJG4-5 (Golemis et al., 1993). For all constructs, levels of expression were examined by immunoblotting either with anti-LexA antibodies (pEG202 constructs) or with anti-haemagglutinin (HA) antibodies (pJG4-5 constructs). Levels of expression were approximately equal for all proteins, indicating that all fusion proteins had comparable stability and so the failure of some to interact with NTF2 was not due to their levels of expression or stability being substantially lower. Several of the nucleoporin repeat-containing plasmids, Nup100p, Nup116p, Nup1p, Nup159p and Nsp1p, were generous gifts from F. Stutz and M. Rosbash, and all had comparable levels of expression and stability (Stutz et al., 1996). Interactions between proteins were examined by transforming pEG202 plasmids into the yeast strain EGY48 (MATa ura3 trp1 his3 lexAopLEU2; see Wong et al., 1997) and pJG4-5 constructs were trans-

formed into EGY42 (MATa ura3 trp1 his3 lexAopLEU2; see Wong et al., 1997). Strains were mated to one another and diploids were selected (Finley & Brent, 1995). An interaction was scored as positive if the diploid was Leu and turned blue on X-gal indicator plates (Finley & Brent, 1995; Gyuris et al., 1993). Interactions were quanti®ed using a b-galactosidase assay (Kaiser et al., 1994). Structure determination using X-ray crystallography Crystals of the E42K and H66A mutants of NTF2 were grown by vapour diffusion under the same conditions as used to grow the wild-type NTF2 crystals described by Ê Kent et al. (1996) and Bullock et al. (1996). A 2.3 A data set was collected for each mutant at room temperature using a 300 mm MAR Research image plate scanner and CuKa radiation from an Elliot GX-13 X-ray source. Data were processed with the DENZO software package (Minor, 1993; Otwinowski, 1993) and CCP4 software (Collaborative Computing Project, number 4, 1994). Table 2 gives the data collection statistics. The space group (orthorhombic P21212Ê1) and unit cell dimensions (a  56 A, b  58 A, c  88 A) for both mutant crystals Ê Ê were the same as for the wild-type crystals, and for each mutant an initial structural model was obtained by rigid body minimisation of the co-ordinates of wild-type NTF2 with the E42K and H66A mutant data sets. Crystallographic model building and re®nement proceeded with the molecular graphics package O ( Jones et al., 1991) and REFMAC (Collaborative Computing Project number 4, 1994). Separate B-factors were obtained for each atom. Water molecules were included where there were peaks above 4s in the electron density calculated with sA-weighted Fo À Fc amplitudes (Read, 1986) and model phases, and where there were potential hydrogen bond donors and acceptors present with good geometry. Table 2 gives the ®nal re®nement statistics. Atomic coordinates for the E42K and H66A mutants have been deposited with the Brookhaven Protein Data Base (identi®cation codes 1ar0 and 1ask, respectively).
