Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, and Division of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115,1 and MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge CB2 2QH, United Kingdom2 Received 4 February 1997/Returned for modification 9 April 1997/Accepted 17 April 1997 Bidirectional movement of proteins and RNAs across the nuclear envelope requires Ran, a Ras-like GTPase. A genetic screen of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was performed to isolate conditional alleles of GSP1, a gene that encodes a homolog of Ran. Two temperature-sensitive alleles, gsp1-1 and gsp1-2, were isolated. The mutations in these two alleles map to regions that are structurally conserved between different members of the Ras family. Each mutant strain exhibits various nuclear transport defects. Both biochemical and genetic experiments indicate a decreased interaction between Ntf2p, a factor which is required for protein import, and the mutant GSP1 gene products. Overexpression of NTF2 can suppress the temperature sensitive phenotype of gsp1-1 and gsp1-2 and partially rescue nuclear transport defects. However, overexpression of a mutant allele of NTF2 with decreased binding to Gsp1p cannot rescue the temperature sensitivity of gsp1-1 and gsp1-2. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the interaction between Gsp1p and Ntf2p is critical for nuclear transport.

A common theme in the regulation of biological processes is the involvement of GTP-binding proteins of the Ras superfamily (16). These small GTPases cycle between GTP- and GDPbound states. They can function as molecular "on/off" switches as in Ras (16), or they can be more like the Rab proteins involved in vesicular transport (63). In this case, the GTP- and GDP-bound states of Rab are involved in the vectorial transport of vesicles to their target membrane. Movement of macromolecules in and out of the nucleus is a highly regulated process which is also controlled by a Ras-like GTPase termed Ran (24, 46, 52). This process of nuclear transport occurs via large proteinaceous channels termed nuclear pores which are embedded in the nuclear envelope. Many of the proteins destined for the nucleus contain short stretches of basic amino acids termed nuclear localization sequences (NLSs), which are necessary for proper import into the nucleus (34, 38, 75). Examples of the classical NLS include those found in SV40, yeast histone 2B protein, and the bipartite NLS in nucleoplasmin. A soluble receptor found in the cytoplasm recognizes NLSs and targets them to the nuclear pore. The NLS receptor is composed of two subunits. An 60-kDa protein called p54/56 (2), Srp1p (79), importin(39), or karyopherin (54) recognizes the NLS. The second subunit, termed p97 (1, 19), importin 90/ (29, 40), or karyopherin (65), is required for targeting the NLS-bearing protein to the nuclear pore. There are other proteins that do not contain a classical NLS but are nevertheless efficiently transported into the nucleus. One such example is the heteronuclear RNA binding proteins (hnRNPs). In mammalian cells, the protein hnRNP A1 can rapidly shuttle in and out of the nucleus yet it does not contain a classical NLS. Instead, it contains a bifunctional import-

export sequence known as an M9 sequence (47, 76). Import of hnRNP A1 uses a mechanism independent of importin- ­ importin- . An importin- -like molecule termed transportin appears to mediate import. Transportin-mediated import of hnRNP A1 does not involve importin- (64). In addition to these receptor molecules, the nuclear transport machinery includes several other factors. Like that of Ras, the GTPase activity of Ran is negligible until it is activated by a GTPase-activating protein (GAP). Rna1p (36) is the identified GAP in yeast (7, 22). In vertebrates, it is known as RanGAP1 (9, 10). Once in the GDP-bound state, Ran must be recycled to the GTP-bound state. An exchange factor, Prp20p (3) (RCC1 in higher eukaryotes), accomplishes this task (12, 56). Two additional proteins interact with Ran to promote translocation across the nuclear pore. Yrb1p (RanBP1 in higher eukaryotes) is required for protein import and poly(A) RNA export (18, 72). It interacts with Ran in the GTP-bound state and further accelerates GTP hydrolysis in the presence of Rna1p (9, 11, 72). The other protein is Ntf2p (also known as p10 or pp15 [23, 51, 61]). Ntf2p can be found as a dimer in a complex with Ran (51, 55, 61). The precise role for Ntf2p has not been established although it has been suggested that it functions to coordinate the association-dissociation of an import complex at the nuclear pore (55). However, there is currently controversy over the importance of Ntf2p in nuclear transport. In some in vitro nuclear import assays, the addition of Ntf2p appears to be unnecessary to promote import (18, 30, 31), whereas in others it facilitates transport (51, 61). Furthermore, conditional alleles of yeast NTF2 exhibit protein import defects in vivo (23). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there are two ran homologs, GSP1 and GSP2 or CNR1 and CNR2. GSP1 was originally isolated as a high-copy suppressor of prp20-1, a mutant allele of the exchange factor (8). A second gene, GSP2, whose gene product is greater than 95% identical to Gsp1p, was also identified in the same screen. CNR1 and CNR2 were isolated in a similar screen and are identical to GSP1 and

FIG. 1. Characterization of gsp1-1 and gsp1-2 mutant phenotypes. (a) GSP1, gsp1-1, and gsp1-2 strains were streaked to YEPD plates and incubated at 25°C or 36°C for 2 days. (b) Growth curves for GSP1, gsp1-1, and gsp1-2 strains at 25°C ( ) and 36°C ({). Overnight cultures of GSP1, gsp1-1, and gsp1-2 strains were diluted into YEPD medium and grown for 4 h at room temperature. Half of each culture was shifted to 36°C. Aliquots of cells were removed at the indicated times and counted.

GSP2 (37). Both gene products are approximately 90% similar to vertebrate Ran, indicating they are the yeast Ran homologs (8). Of the two genes, only GSP1 is essential. Although the gene products of GSP1 and GSP2 are virtually identical, GSP2 can only rescue the GSP1 null strain if it is present on a high-copy plasmid (8). The physiological role of GSP2 is unclear, but it may be required only under certain growth conditions. In order to understand how Ran regulates nuclear transport, we have used the yeast S. cerevisiae as a model system. We have generated two conditional alleles of GSP1 and studied the effects of the mutations both biochemically and genetically to determine the molecular basis for the loss of function of Gsp1p. From this analysis, we demonstrate that Gsp1p is required for both classical and nonclassical nuclear import pathways and that an interaction between Gsp1p and Ntf2p is required for efficient nuclear transport. MATERIALS AND METHODS All chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Mo.) except where noted. All DNA manipulations were performed according to standard methods (69), and all yeast media were prepared by standard procedures (66). Plasmids. The plasmid YEp24-GSP1 (pPS984) was a gift of M. Clark (University of Toronto). Plasmid pPS985 was generated by cloning an 2.8-kb HincII/ PstI fragment from YEp24-GSP1 into pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.). Plasmid pPS965 was made by cloning an 3-kb ApaI/SacI fragment from pPS985 into pRS314 (CEN-TRP1) (74). Plasmids pPS986 (CEN-TRP1-gsp1-1) and pPS987 (CEN-TRP1-gsp1-2) are the original plasmids isolated from the genetic screen described below. The plasmids pPS1023 (2 m NTF2), pPS1024 (2 m ntf2-1) and pPS1025 (2 m ntf2-2) were made by cloning a 3-kb PstI/SacI fragment from pPS882 (CEN-LEU2-NTF2), pPS919 (CEN-LEU2-ntf2-1), and pPS920 (CEN-LEU2ntf2-2) into pRS425 (2 m LEU2) (74). The Ntf2p bacterial expression plasmid pPS982 was made by amplifying the coding region of Ntf2p by PCR with Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.). Primers were designed to introduce BamHI and HindIII sites at the 5 and 3 ends, respectively. The PCR product was cloned into the T7-based expression vector pMW172 (78). Two-hybrid constructs were made by amplifying the coding region of wild-type and mutant Ntf2p, Gsp1p, Ran, and Ras by PCR. Primers were designed to introduce various sites at the 5 and 3 ends and were then cloned into either pEG202 or pJG4-5 (33). The following sites were added to the various PCR products: XhoI and XhoI to GSP1 and EcoRI and XhoI to NTF2, ran, and ras. Strains. The coding regions of GSP1 and GSP2 were replaced with HIS3 by a PCR-based knockout protocol (6). PCR with Vent polymerase was used to generate a HIS3 fragment flanked by 45 bp directly 5 and 3 of the GSP1 and GSP2 coding regions. The two PCR products were individually transformed into the diploid yeast strain PSY845 (MATa/ ura3-52/ura3-52 leu2 1/leu2 1 his3 200/his3 200 trp1 63/TRP1), and His transformants were selected. Correct integration of the HIS3 gene was confirmed by PCR analysis and by Southern blotting. Diploids containing the desired knockout were sporulated, and tetrads were dissected. In the case of the GSP1 knockout, the diploid strain was first transformed with YEp24-GSP1 before sporulation and dissection. All complete tetrads showed 2:2 segregation of the His prototrophy, and for GSP1 knockouts, all His spores were sensitive to 5 fluoroorotic acid indicating that these spores required YEp24-GSP1 to survive. Yeast strains PSY960 (MAT gsp2::HIS3 ura3-52 leu2 1 his3 200) and PSY961 (MATa gsp1::HIS3 ura3-52 leu2 1 his3 200 trp1 63) were isolated from these dissections. Yeast strain PSY962 (MAT gsp1::HIS3 gsp2::HIS3 ura3-52 leu2 1 his3 200 trp1 63) was isolated as one of two His spores from the nonparental ditype tetrad of a cross between PSY960 and PSY961. GSP1, gsp1-1, and gsp1-2 strains in this study were made by the plasmid shuffle method (73) where the wild-type plasmid copy of GSP1 in strain PSY962 was replaced by centromeric plasmids carrying GSP1, gsp1-1, or gsp1-2 (pPS965, pPS986, and pPS987, respectively). PCR mutagenesis. Recessive, temperature-sensitive alleles of GSP1 were generated by taking advantage of the high error rate of Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, Wis.). An 1.3-kb PCR product was generated. This product contains the entire GSP1 open reading frame including 155 bp upstream of the initiation codon and 502 bp downstream of the stop codon. The PCR product was generated with Taq polymerase under mutagenic conditions (4 mM MgCl2) and purified on a Qiaquick PCR column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, Calif.). The plasmid pPS965 was linearized with ClaI and NcoI to remove an 1.1-kb insert containing the coding region of GSP1. Gap repair ligation (57) was achieved by cotransforming the strain PSY962 with the PCR product and linear pPS965. We chose to use the strain PSY962 ( gsp1 gsp2) to prevent upregulation of GSP2 that might rescue any plasmid-linked temperature-sensitive phenotype. Colonies were selected on synthetic complete medium (SC) lacking tryptophan. The plates were then replica plated to SC plates lacking tryptophan, supplemented with 1 mg of 5 fluoroorotic acid/ml and 7.5 mg of the vital dye Erythrocin B/liter, and placed at 25 and 36°C. Uptake of the Erythrocin B dye by dead cells, which

FIG. 2. H2B-NLS- -galactosidase is mislocalized at the nonpermissive temperature. GSP1, gsp1-1, and gsp1-2 strains were transformed with a plasmid encoding the NLS of yeast H2B fused to -galactosidase (pPS613) (53). Cells were induced for 1 h with 2% galactose, and half the cells were shifted to 36°C for 1 h before being prepared for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. The reporter construct was visualized with a monoclonal antibody against -galactosidase (diluted 1:800) (mAb J2F7) at 25°C (A, G, and M) and 36°C (D, J, and P). The nuclei, visualized with DAPI (B, E, H, K, N and Q) and Nomarski optics (C, F, I, L, O and R), correspond to those shown in panels A, D, G, J, M, and P, respectively.

results in a pink colony, was used to identify temperature-sensitive colonies. Plasmids were rescued from temperature-sensitive colonies and retransformed into PSY962 and PSY961 to confirm plasmid linkage of the temperature-sensitive phenotype. Plasmids that retested for temperature sensitivity were sequenced to identify the mutations. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and in situ hybridization. Five milliliters of cells was grown in the appropriate medium to approximately 107 cells/ml and fixed with 700 l of 37% formaldehyde for 60 to 90 min. Following fixation, cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) and resuspended in 500 l of P solution (1.2 M sorbitol, 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer [pH 6.5]). Dithiothreitol (DTT) was added to 25 mM, and the cells were incubated at 30°C for 10 min with gentle agitation followed by addition of 300 g of Zymolyase 100T (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, Calif.)/ml (diluted from 10-mg/ml stock in P solution). Digestion of the cell wall was monitored by bright-field microscopy. Digested cells were resuspended in 500 l of P solution and applied to Teflon-faced microscope slides precoated with 0.3% polylysine. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in P solution for 5 min. Permeabilized cells were processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy or in situ hybridization. (i) Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. This procedure is a modification of that described by Flach et al. (26). Briefly, permeabilized cells were treated with blocking solution (5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 0.3% Triton X-100, 0.1 M Tris [pH 9.5], 0.1 M NaCl) for 15 min. Antibodies diluted in blocking solution were applied to cells and incubated for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. Cells were washed twice for 10 to 30 min each time with antibody wash 1 (0.1 M Tris [pH 9.0], 0.15 M NaCl). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)- or Texas Red-coupled secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit or antimouse immunoglobulin G; Jackson Immunologicals, West Grove, Pa.) was diluted 1:1,000 in blocking solution and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with antibody wash 1 for 10 to 30 min and then twice for 10 to 30 min with antibody wash 2 (0.1 M Tris [pH 9.5], 0.1 M NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2). DNA in the nuclei was visualized by treating cells with 1 g of 4 ,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)/ml in antibody wash 2 for 5 min followed by two 5-min rinses with antibody wash 2. Cells were air dried and mounted in antifade solution (1 mg of p-phenylene diamine/ml in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]­90% glycerol) under a coverslip. Slides were sealed with nail polish. For experiments with the artificial reporter construct H2B-NLS- -galactosidase, GSP1, gsp1-1, and gsp1-2 cells were transformed with pPS613 (53). Single colonies were grown overnight at room temperature in SC medium which lacked uracil and which was supplemented with 2% glucose. The overnight cultures of GSP1 and gsp1-1 cells were diluted 1:200 into uracil-lacking SC medium supplemented with 2% raffinose. Cells from gsp1-2 cultures were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in uracil-lacking SC medium supplemented with 2% raffinose. All raffinose cultures were then grown for 22 h at room temperature followed by a 1-h induction with 2% galactose at room temperature. Half of each culture was shifted to 36°C for 1 h and fixed for 1 h with formaldehyde. Cell walls were digested as described above. Cells were affixed to polylysine-coated slides and permeabilized in ice-cold methanol for 6 min followed by immersion in ice-cold acetone for 30 s. Slides were air dried and processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy as described above. (ii) In situ hybridization. This procedure is a modification of that described by Amberg et al. (5). Triton X-100-permeabilized cells were treated for 2 min with freshly prepared 0.1 M triethanolamine (pH 8.0) followed by a 10-min treatment with 0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1 M triethanolamine (pH 8.0) to block polar groups. The cells were then treated with prehybridization solution (50% deionized formamide, 4 SSC [1 SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate] 1 Denhardt's solution, 125 g of tRNA/ml, 10% dextran sulfate, 500 g of denatured salmon sperm DNA/ml) for 1 h at 37°C. Digoxigenin-labeled oligo(dT) probe (50-mer) (prepared with a Genius-6 kit [Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, Ind.]) diluted in prehybridization solution was applied to samples, and samples were incubated overnight at 37°C in a humidified chamber. The following day, cells were washed as follows: 1 h in 2 SSC at room temperature, 1 h in 1 SSC at room temperature, 30 min in 0.5 SSC at 37°C, and 30 min in 0.5 SSC at room temperature. Following hybridization and washes, cells were treated as described above for the indirect immunofluorescence microscopy samples. The hybridized oligonucleotide was visualized with FITC-labeled antidigoxigenin Fab fragments (Boehringer Mannheim) diluted 1:200 in antibody blocking solution. Ntf2p binding experiments. GSP1, gsp1-1, or gsp1-2 cells were grown overnight at room temperature in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YEPD) medium to confluency. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with water and once in PBSM (PBS, 3 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2). Cells were then resus-

FIG. 3. Conditional GSP1 alleles show differing levels of transport defects. GSP1, gsp1-1, and gsp1-2 strains were grown to approximately 107 cells/ml in liquid YEPD medium. Half of the cells were left at room temperature (a) and half were shifted to 36°C for 3 (b). Cells were fixed and processed for both protein import (panels A, E, and I) and poly(A) RNA export (panels B, F, and J) assays using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with an antibody against Npl3p and in situ hybridization with an digoxigenin-labeled dT50 oligonucleotide probe, respectively. Npl3p antibodies were visualized with Texas Red­goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G, and hybridized nucleotide probe was visualized with FITC-conjugated anti digoxigenin Fab fragments. The corresponding DAPI images (panels C, G, and K) and Nomarski images (panels D, H, and L) are included.

One volume of glass beads was added, and cells were lysed with two 60-s pulses in a beadbeater. The resulting lysate was clarified by centrifugation and assayed for protein concentration by using the BioRad Protein Assay Kit

(Richmond, Calif.). Typically, 300 l of yeast lysate (30 mg/ml) was incubated with 50

polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (42) and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting (77). Ntf2p purification and immobilization. Yeast Ntf2p was purified from Escherichia coli as previously described for rat Ntf2p (39). pPS982 was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). Transformants were inoculated into 2 tryptone-yeast extract medium containing 100 g of ampicillin/ml and grown overnight at 34°C. It was not necessary to induce expression as the basal level of expression of the T7 polymerase yielded a large amount of Ntf2p. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and stored at 20°C until required. Ntf2p was isolated by thawing the cell pellets and resuspending them in 25% sucrose­50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0]­5 mM MgCl2­1 mM EGTA­0.1 mM PMSF.

Ntf2p-Sepharose beads (see below). Binding was carried out in PBSM (total volume, 1 ml) at 4°C for 1 h. Beads were then washed three times in 1 ml of PBSM. Bound proteins were eluted with 50 l of sample buffer and resolved by

Cells were lysed by incubation with 10 mg of lysozyme/ml followed by treatment with DNase. The soluble fraction was isolated by centrifugation at 40,000 g for 15 min and dialyzed overnight against 20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0]­2 mM MgCl2­1 mM DTT­0.1 mM PMSF (NTF2 buffer A). The dialysate was clarified at 40,000 g for 20 min at 4°C and applied to a DE52 ion exchange column (10 by 2.5 cm) and washed with NTF2 buffer A. Ntf2p was eluted with a gradient of 0 to 400 mM NaCl. Fractions containing Ntf2p were pooled, resuspended in a minimal volume of 20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4]­50 mM NaCl­2 mM MgCl2­1 mM DTT­0.1 mM PMSF (NTF2 buffer B), and applied to a column of Sephacryl SR100 (95 by 2.5 cm) preequilibrated in NTF2 buffer B. Fractions containing Ntf2p were collected and pooled. Purified Ntf2p was cross-linked to CNBr-Sepharose as previously described (21). Briefly, CNBr-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.) were swollen and washed in 1 mM HCl. Beads were transferred to coupling buffer (100 mM NaHCO3 [pH 8.3], 500 mM NaCl) and added to 10 mg of Ntf2p in coupling buffer. Coupling was carried out at room temperature for 2 h. Residual active groups were blocked with 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 2 h at room temperature. Beads were then washed successively and extensively four times in coupling buffer and acid wash buffer (0.1 M sodium acetate [pH 4.0], 500 mM NaCl). Two-hybrid interaction assays. All constructs were tested for expression of a fusion protein of the appropriate size. pEG202 constructs were transformed into EGY48 (MAT ura3 trp 1 his3 lexAopLEU2) and pJG4-5 constructs were transformed into EGY42 (MATa ura3 trp 1 his3 lexAopLEU2) (gift of Roger Brent, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Ma.). Strains were crossed, and diploids were selected. An interaction is scored positive if the diploid becomes Leu , turns blue on X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl- -D-galactopyranoside) indicator plates, and tests positive in -galactosidase activity assays as described in references 25 and 27. In typical -galactosidase assays, positive interactions were scored if the optical density at 420 nm (OD420) was between 0.2 and 0.4. For negative interactions, the OD420 was 0.05. RESULTS Isolation of conditional alleles of GSP1. To study the function of Gsp1p in vivo, we generated conditional alleles of GSP1 and characterized their temperature-sensitive phenotypes. Conditional alleles of GSP1 were generated in a haploid yeast strain in which the chromosomal copy of GSP1 was replaced by HIS3. Viability of the strain was maintained by a wild-type copy of GSP1 carried on an episomal plasmid. Since the GSP2 gene product is virtually identical to that of GSP1 (8), the chromosomal copy of GSP2 (which is not essential) was also replaced by HIS3 to eliminate the possibility that upregulation of GSP2

might suppress the GSP1 temperature-sensitive phenotype. In the screen, the wild-type plasmid copy of GSP1 was replaced by a PCR-mutagenized copy carried on a centromeric plasmid (see Materials and Methods). After screening approximately 60,000 colonies, two transformants that displayed plasmidlinked temperature sensitivity were found: gsp1-1 and gsp1-2 (Fig. 1A). Both strains also exhibited slowed growth in liquid culture compared to cells containing wild-type GSP1 at the nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 1B). Mutant alleles of GSP1 have nuclear transport defects. To determine whether gsp1-1 and gsp1-2 strains have nuclear transport defects, we used indirect immunofluorescence microscopy to examine protein import. To assay for nuclear import, we localized an artificial reporter construct consisting of a classical NLS (yeast histone 2B) fused to -galactosidase (H2B- -gal) (53) as well as an endogenous protein, Npl3p (15, 26), which does not contain a classical NLS. We chose to localize both classes of nuclear proteins in mutant cells because there is emerging evidence that the import of different proteins occurs via distinct mechanisms (see Discussion). In cells containing a wild-type copy of GSP1, H2B- -gal was localized to the nucleus at both 25 and 36°C. (Fig. 2A and D). Similarly, in both mutant strains the reporter protein can be detected in the nucleus at the permissive temperature, although a large proportion is cytoplasmic (Fig. 2G and M). Following a 1-h shift to 36°C, H2B- -gal becomes mislocalized to the cytoplasm in both gsp1-1 and gsp1-2 cells (Fig. 2J and P). The nuclear signal observed in some cells at the nonpermissive temperature is most likely due to protein which has been imported into the nucleus prior to the temperature shift. In cells containing a wild-type copy of GSP1, the steady-state distribution of endogenous Npl3p is nuclear at both 25 and 36°C (Fig. 3a and b, panel A). In both mutant strains, Npl3p is mainly nuclear at the permissive temperature (Fig. 3a, panels E and I). Following a 3-h shift to 36°C, Npl3p becomes severely mislocalized to the cytoplasm in gsp1-1 cells (Fig. 3b, panel E). In gsp1-2 cells, the majority of Npl3p is cytoplasmic although some nuclear Npl3p is still visible in some cells (Fig. 3b, panel I). The effect of the temperature shift is rapid; Npl3p accumulates in the cytoplasm as early as 10 min after the shift to the nonpermissive temperature in gsp1-1 cells and after approximately 30 min in gsp1-2 cells (data not shown). These results demonstrate that protein import into the nucleus is impaired in the absence of a functional copy of GSP1. Poly(A) RNA export in these mutants was also examined by using an in situ hybridization assay (see Materials and Methods). In wild-type cells, poly(A) RNA is efficiently exported out of the nucleus and is localized in the cytoplasm at 25 and 36°C (Fig. 3a and b, panel B). Both mutant strains also display a cytoplasmic distribution of poly(A) RNA at the permissive temperature (Fig. 3a, panels F and J). However, upon shift to 36°C, gsp1-1 displays a poly(A) RNA export defect (Fig. 3b, panel F). In contrast, poly(A) RNA export appears unaffected in gsp1-2 (compare Fig. 3b, panels F and J). The onset of the poly(A) RNA export defect can be detected within 30 min of shifting gsp1-1 cells to 36°C (data not shown). Mutations in gsp1-1 and gsp1-2 map to regions structurally conserved between Ran and Ras. X-ray crystallography studies (71) have shown that although the amino acid sequences of human Ran and Ras are only about 25% homologous (24), the three-dimensional structures of the core domains of the two proteins are remarkably similar. Both structures consist of a G domain constructed from a six-stranded sheet surrounded by five helices that is basically conserved between Ras, EF-Tu, transducin- , and EF-G (71). Ran is, however, significantly different at its C terminus and in the effector loop region. In

Secondary structural elements are displayed below the sequence. Shaded boxes indicate sheets and black boxes indicate helices. Numbering of the structural elements follows that indicated in Scheffzek et al. (71). The amino acid changes in Gsp1-1p are H503L (CAT to CTT), L1103S (TTA to TCA) and A1353V (GCC to GTC) and the amino acid changes in Gsp1-2p are in I613F (ATT to TTT), W663R (TGG to AGG) and V1033A (GTT to GCT).

Ras, it is the effector loop that binds to several different proteins. Human Ran and Gsp1p are highly homologous (greater than 90%) over most of their amino acid sequences (Fig. 4). Although it has not yet been determined by X-ray crystallography, the three-dimensional structure of Gsp1p is unlikely to differ markedly from that of human Ran. Both mutant alleles of GSP1 have point mutations that are located in regions that are structurally conserved between human Ran and Ras (see Fig. 4). Each mutant allele of GSP1 has three point mutations: in the gsp1-1 gene product these changes are H503L, L1103S, and A1353V, whereas in the gsp1-2 gene product the changes are I613F, W663R, and V1033A. Separation of the L1103S and A1353V mutations from H503L in gsp1-1 resulted in loss of the conditional phenotype, suggesting that the temperature sensitivity of the mutant strains resulted from the cumulative effect of the three point mutations (data not shown). Because three point mutations were required to generate the conditional phenotype, it is not surprising that conditional alleles were only isolated under highly mutagenic conditions and that only single isolates of each were obtained. Overexpression of Ntf2p partially rescues the temperaturesensitive phenotypes of gsp1-1 and gsp1-2. What is the basis for


VOL. 17, 1997 the temperature-sensitive growth of mutant GSP1 alleles? One possibility is that mutant proteins are unstable at the nonpermissive temperature. In the case of gsp1-1 and gsp1-2, the protein levels of mutant Gsp1p do not appear to be grossly affected at the nonpermissive temperature (data not shown). Another possibility which may cause conditional growth is a decreased interaction between the mutant gene product and one or more interacting proteins. Overexpression of the interacting protein may be able to shift the equilibrium from the noninteracting state to the interacting state. In order to identify what interaction(s) may be weakened with the mutant GSP1 alleles, we overexpressed several known nuclear transport factors. We tested YRB1, YRB2, RNA1, PRP20, KAP95/ RSL1, KAP104, KAP121/PSE1, KAP123, and NTF2. Of these, only NTF2 could suppress the temperature-sensitive phenotype of gsp1-1 and gsp1-2 (Fig. 5A). Overexpressing NTF2, however, cannot rescue a GSP1 knockout strain, indicating that the suppression by NTF2 is not via a bypass mechanism (78a). We tested whether overexpressing NTF2 could also suppress the nuclear transport defects in mutant GSP1 strains. Cells containing a high-copy NTF2 plasmid or a control plasmid were tested by using in situ hybridization and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. When mutant cells contained a high-copy NTF2 plasmid, rescue of some of the temperaturesensitive phenotypes was observed. In gsp1-1 cells, less than 25% of the cells exhibit a poly(A) RNA export defect at the restrictive temperature (Fig. 5b, compare panels A and D). However, overexpression of NTF2 could not rescue the Npl3p mislocalization defect (Fig. 5c, panel D). In constrast, the import defect observed in gsp1-2 cells is rescued: in most of the cells, Npl3p is localized to the nucleus (Fig. 5c, panel J). Similar results were observed with the H2B- -gal reporter construct (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that overexpression of Ntf2p can overcome many of the molecular defects in gsp1-1 and gsp1-2. Mutant Gsp1p has altered affinity for recombinant Ntf2p. Overexpression studies suggested that mutant Gsp1p proteins have a weakened interaction with Ntf2p. To test this hypothesis, we assayed the Ntf2p-Gsp1p interaction using bacterially expressed yeast Ntf2p bound to Sepharose beads. Previous work has shown that rat Ntf2p-Sepharose is able to bind both bacterially expressed Ran and Ran from rat liver homogenates (17, 21). Although immunoblots demonstrated that Ntf2pSepharose was able to bind wild-type Gsp1p from yeast lysates, neither Gsp1-1p nor Gsp1-2p bound significantly under these conditions (Fig. 6, lanes 2 and 3), suggesting that the interaction between Ntf2p and the mutated proteins is weaker than that between Ntf2p and wild-type Gsp1p. The interaction between Ntf2p-Sepharose and the nucleoporin Nsp1p is unaffected in wild-type and mutant lysates (Fig. 6, lanes 2 and 3). The inability of mutated Gsp1p to bind to Ntf2p-Sepharose could be attributed to differences in affinity for guanine nucleotide. In fact, both Gsp1-1p and Gsp1-2p fail to bind either GTP or GDP in vitro (78a). A caveat to this interpretation is that the mutated proteins may be more susceptible to denaturation during the purification and therefore fail to bind guanine nucleotide. Mutant Ntf2p proteins have altered interactions. Previously, we isolated conditional alleles of NTF2 which exhibit nuclear import defects at the nonpermissive temperature (23). To characterize the molecular basis for their defects, we mapped the mutations to the recently solved crystal structure of rat Ntf2p (17). We used the rat structure because the structure of yeast Ntf2p has not yet been solved. However, when yeast Ntf2p was modeled on rat Ntf2p, the two structures were found

to be very similar (23a). In addition, human Ntf2p (which is identical to rat Ntf2p) can functionally substitute for yeast Ntf2p, indicating that the two molecules are sufficiently structurally conserved to be able to interact with other components of the yeast nuclear transport machinery (23). Point mutations in Ntf2p map to different sides of the molecule (Fig. 7). The mutation in Ntf2-1p (M833T) is located in the interface between molecules in the dimer. The mutation in Ntf2-2p (D913G) occurs in a loop which has been hypothesized to interact with Ran (17). Thus, ntf2-2 strains may be temperature sensitive due to a weakened interaction with Ran. To test this hypothesis, we used a two-hybrid assay (33) to measure the interactions between wild-type and mutant Ntf2p and Gsp1p. To validate this approach, we tested whether or not two-hybrid constructs for NTF2 and GSP1 interact as they do in biochemical assays. Various studies have shown that Ntf2p forms a dimer (14, 49, 59). In a two-hybrid assay, Ntf2p interacts with itself indicating that Ntf2p also dimerizes in yeast (Table 1). Not only do yeast and human Ntf2p interact with themselves, they also interact with each other. Also, in agreement with biochemical data, human Ran can interact with human Ntf2p (Table 1) (17, 49, 55, 59). It is also interesting to note that both Gsp1p and Ran can interact with either yeast or human Ntf2p, indicating that their interaction is conserved between species (Table 1). The interaction between yeast and human Ntf2p and Gsp1p and Ran is specific since Ntf2p does not interact with another small GTPase, Ras, nor does Gsp1p interact with itself or Ran (Table 1). Thus, Ntf2p and Gsp1p interact appropriately in the two-hybrid system. Having validated this approach, we tested the interaction between the mutant Ntf2p proteins and Gsp1p in the twohybrid system. In the case of the Ntf2p mutants, differences in interaction are observed. Both proteins are expressed at approximately equal levels and can interact with Nsp1p (Table 2). As predicted, the interaction between Ntf2-2p and Gsp1p is lost while the interaction between Ntf2-1p and Gsp1p is unaffected (Table 2). Overexpression of ntf2-1 but not ntf2-2 can suppress conditional GSP1 alleles. It is possible that the overexpression of NTF2 rescues the temperature-sensitive phenotype indirectly through an interaction with other components of the nuclear transport machinery and not with Gsp1p directly. In order to test if the direct interaction between Ntf2p and mutant Gsp1p proteins was indeed the cause of the rescue, we overexpressed the mutant NTF2 alleles in wild-type and mutant GSP1 strains. The predicted outcome is that only overexpression of ntf2-1, a mutant which can still interact with Gsp1p, would be able to rescue the temperature sensitivity of GSP1 mutants. The results were as predicted: only overexpression of ntf2-1 could rescue mutant GSP1 alleles (Fig. 8). Overexpression of ntf2-1 could rescue the transport defects in mutant GSP1 strains to the same extent as overexpression of wild-type NTF2 (data not shown). DISCUSSION Within the past few years, the mechanism by which macromolecules traverse the nuclear envelope has begun to be understood. In vitro assays which reconstitute protein import into the nucleus have been instrumental in identifying factors that are required for this process. One such factor is the Ras-like GTPase Ran (46, 50). To understand how Ran regulates nuclear transport in vivo, we have generated two conditional alleles of GSP1, a gene which encodes a Ran homolog, in the yeast S. cerevisiae. Both gsp1-1 and gsp1-2 exhibit nuclear transport defects. Overexpression of Ntf2p can rescue the temper-

ature-sensitive phenotype, but overexpression of a mutant allele of NTF2 with a decreased affinity for Gsp1p cannot rescue the temperature-sensitive phenotype of mutant GSP1 alleles, emphasizing the importance of this interaction for the proper function of the nuclear protein import machinery. Implications for other Ras-like GTPases. The isolation of temperature-sensitive alleles of GSP1 has been a difficult process, and prior to this study, no conditional alleles existed. Temperature-sensitive alleles of GSP1 were obtained only under highly mutagenic conditions and in a genetic background where GSP2 was absent. In our genetic screen, only two single isolates were obtained. Each mutant contained three mutations in the coding region, all of which appear to be important for temperature sensitivity. Thus, generating conditional alleles of GSP1 is a rare event. Ran is a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases. The Ras-like GTPases all have a common G domain constructed from a central six-stranded sheet surrounded by five helices and connected by a common pattern of loops (reviewed in reference 71). This G domain contains the binding site for guanine nucleotides and undergoes a significant conformational change between GTP- and GDP-bound forms. A

Proteins from these lysates which bound recombinant yeast Ntf2p immobilized on CNBr-Sepharose beads were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Gsp1p antisera (gift of P. Belhumeur and M.

range of other proteins interact with these GTPases, often involving the loop regions. Moreover, the binding of these proteins is often modulated by the nucleotide state of the GTPase. Although conditional mutants of some members of the Ras family of GTPases have been described, these mutations are not located in the regions of the G domain that are

strongly conserved (68). In contrast, the mutations in gsp1-1 and gsp1-2 described in the present study are located in the sheets that form the backbone of the G domain. Consequently, these GSP1 mutants may form the basis for constructing conditional alleles of Ras and other members of the Ras superfamily. Mutant GSP1 alleles exhibit nuclear transport defects. There is emerging evidence that different classes of nuclear proteins enter the nucleus via different mechanisms. Nuclear proteins containing classical NLSs (e.g., SV40 and H2B) enter the nucleus via the importin- ­importin- pathway (19, 32). Npl3p, a yeast hnRNP, is a protein which rapidly shuttles in and out of the nucleus but does not contain any sequence motif resembling a classical NLS. Also, there is evidence suggesting that Npl3p enters the nucleus via a mechanism distinct from the classical NLS receptor. Conditional alleles of SRP1 and RSL1, the yeast homologs of importin- and importin- , respectively, do not mislocalize Npl3p at the nonpermissive temperature although they do mislocalize proteins containing classical NLSs (40, 44). Additional evidence for a distinct import pathway comes from work with the mammalian shuttling protein hnRNP A1. This protein does not have a classical NLS. Instead, it has a bifunctional import-export signal known as an M9 sequence (47, 76). A different receptor, termed transportin, mediates its import (64). Transportin is an approximately 100-kDa protein that is distantly related to importin- and is involved in the import of hnRNP A1. Like Npl3p import, this process does not appear to require importin- (64). To determine whether or not these two classes of protein are dependent on Ran for import into the nucleus, we localized both types of protein in mutant GSP1 strains. In these strains, we demonstrate the rapid onset of a protein import defect upon shift to the nonpermissive temperature. In the case of the

classical NLS, we examined the localization of an artificial reporter construct consisting of the NLS from the yeast histone 2B (H2B) fused to -galactosidase (53). In the case of the nonclassical NLS, we used Npl3p (15, 26). In both cases, protein import into the nucleus was inhibited at the nonpermissive temperature in mutant GSP1 alleles, indicating that although the mechanisms by which these proteins enter are different, both pathways involve Ran. In addition to importin- , three additional importin- homologs have been identified in the S. cerevisiae genome. KAP104 appears to be a yeast homolog of the mammalian transportin (4, 64). The other two importin- homologs are PSE1 and KAP123. PSE1 was previously identified as a multicopy enhancer of protein secretion (20), whereas KAP123 is a previously uncharacterized open reading frame. The roles of Pse1p and Kap123p in nuclear transport have not been clearly established. Once these roles have been determined, and if they indeed function at all in nuclear transport, it will be important to see if Ran is also involved in Pse1p- and Kap123p-mediated transport.

The observations above have important implications for how Ran functions in the cell. Ran has been implicated in a variety of processes including protein import, RNA export, mitotic regulation, and cell cycle progression (reviewed in references 67 and 70). Ran may affect all these processes directly or it may only affect a subset, the others being downstream of the initial defect. Given the rapid onset of the nuclear transport defects and the lack of any other noticeable phenotype, our observations with these particular alleles of GSP1 suggest the latter model. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of isolating mutant alleles of GSP1 which affect processes other than nuclear transport. A direct interaction between Gsp1p and Ntf2p is required for nuclear import in vivo. We used biochemical and genetic approaches to address the way in which the temperature sensitivity of gsp1-1 and gsp1-2 was manifested. The ability of the mutant alleles to grow at the permissive temperature indicates that, under these conditions, the function of Gsp1p and especially its interactions with other components of the nuclear transport machinery is not grossly impaired. Genetic studies suggested that the strength of the interaction between mutant Gsp1p and Ntf2p is reduced. We used biochemical as well as more directed genetic tests to further test this hypothesis at the molecular level. Biochemical experiments demonstrated that there is indeed a weakened interaction between Ntf2p and mutant Gsp1p proteins. This loss of binding appears to be independent of temperature. It is not unusual for the gene products of temperature-sensitive alleles to be nonfunctional in vitro even when prepared at the permissive temperature (22, 45, 48). Thus these in vitro observations most likely reflect changes in the interactions involving the mutant GSP1 gene products in vivo at the nonpermissive temperature. Although overexpression of NTF2 can rescue the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of both gsp1-1 and gsp1-2, it may seem paradoxical that the protein import defect in gsp1-1 is not suppressed at the nonpermissive temperature. One possible interpretation of this result is that the amount of nuclear import is sufficient to support growth albeit at a level too low to detect by immunofluorescence assays. Two observations support this explanation. First, nuclear import is already slightly impaired at the permissive temperature in gsp1-1 cells, suggesting that a completely functional transport machinery is not required for viability. Slight nuclear transport defects have also been observed in other nuclear transport mutants at the permissive temperature (13). Second, overexpression of Ntf2p can rescue the poly(A) RNA export defect, suggesting that there is partial rescue of protein import. Npl3p has been shown to be an important mediator of poly(A) RNA export (43). Hence the transport of Npl3p in and out of the nucleus must be at least partially rescued in order to restore poly(A) RNA export. A model for Ntf2p function. Recently there has been controversy over the role of Ntf2p in nuclear import. In some studies using in vitro nuclear import assays, it is not necessary to add Ntf2p (18, 28, 30). However, we have previously shown that Ntf2p plays an essential role in nuclear import in vivo (23). How can we reconcile the difference between these in vitro and in vivo studies? A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that in some in vitro assay systems, residual Ntf2p remains in the permeabilized cells. Another possibility is that Ran has been added in excess of what is required for import, thus bypassing the need for Ntf2p. In fact, this situation can be mimicked in vivo as overexpression of GSP1 can rescue a strain where NTF2 is deleted (60). In the present study, we demonstrate that the interaction

between Ntf2p and Gsp1p is required for nuclear import in vivo. The most compelling evidence for this interaction is the observation that overexpression of Ntf2-2p, a mutated protein with decreased interaction for Gsp1p, failed to rescue the temperature sensitivity of mutant GSP1 strains. The most plausible mechanism to account for this observation would be that, at the nonpermissive temperature, the interaction between Ntf2p and the mutated Gsp1p proteins is reduced to such a low level that quantities of the Ntf2p-Gsp1p complex sufficient to enable adequate nuclear transport in the cells are not produced. Overexpression of Ntf2p would, through Le Cha^telier's principle, increase the amount of complex formed and so enable adequate nuclear transport to take place. How does Ntf2p function in concert with Gsp1p? Ntf2p has been shown to interact with the nucleoporin, p62 and has been localized to the nuclear pore (17, 21, 58, 59, 61). Ntf2p interacts with Ran-GDP as well as importin- (59, 62). Thus Ntf2p may serve to direct the various nuclear transport factors to the nuclear pore and thus promote translocation through the pore. This working hypothesis provides a framework for future experiments. These conditional alleles of GSP1 will provide a valuable tool for an integrated approach of biochemistry, genetics, and cell biology to further dissect the nuclear transport machinery.
