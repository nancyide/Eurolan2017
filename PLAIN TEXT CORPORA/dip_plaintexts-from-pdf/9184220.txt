The RHO1 gene encodes a homologue of mammalian RhoA small G-protein in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Rho1p is required for bud formation and is localized at a bud tip or a cytokinesis site. We have recently shown that Bni1p is a potential target of Rho1p. Bni1p shares the FH1 and FH2 domains with proteins involved in cytokinesis or establishment of cell polarity. In S.cerevisiae, there is an open reading frame (YIL159W) which encodes another protein having the FH1 and FH2 domains and we have named this gene BNR1 (BNI1 Related). Bnr1p interacts with another Rho family member, Rho4p, but not with Rho1p. Disruption of BNI1 or BNR1 does not show any deleterious effect on cell growth, but the bni1 bnr1 mutant shows a severe temperature-sensitive growth phenotype. Cells of the bni1 bnr1 mutant arrested at the restrictive temperature are deficient in bud emergence, exhibit a random distribution of cortical actin patches and often become multinucleate. These phenotypes are similar to those of the mutant of PFY1, which encodes profilin, an actin-binding protein. Moreover, yeast two-hybrid and biochemical studies demonstrate that Bni1p and Bnr1p interact directly with profilin at the FH1 domains. These results indicate that Bni1p and Bnr1p are potential targets of the Rho family members, interact with profilin and regulate the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton.

Introduction The Rho family belongs to the small G-protein superfamily consisting of the Rho, Rac and Cdc42 subfamilies (Hall, 1994; Takai et al., 1995). Evidence is accumulating that, through the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, Rho regulates various cell functions, such as cell morphological change, formation of stress fibres and focal adhesions, cell motility, membrane ruffling, cytokinesis, cell aggregation and smooth muscle contraction. Rho has two interconvertible forms: GDP-bound inactive and GTP-bound active forms. The GDP-bound form is converted to the GTPbound form by the GDP/GTP exchange reaction which is regulated by two types of regulatory proteins: the GDP/ GTP exchange proteins (GEPs), which stimulate the GDP/

GTP exchange reaction, and the GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), which inhibit it. The GTP-bound form interacts with its specific downstream target and performs its cell functions. Thereafter, the GTP-bound form is converted to the GDP-bound form by the GTPase reaction which is regulated by the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Recently, various proteins have been identified as potential targets of Rho (Leung et al., 1995; Madaule et al., 1995; Amano et al., 1996; Ishizaki et al., 1996; Matsui et al., 1996; Watanabe et al., 1996). However, it remains to be clarified whether these target proteins of Rho are involved in the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton. Very recently, one of these proteins, Rho kinase, has been shown to inhibit the myosin phosphatase activity (Kimura et al., 1996), although its physiological significance remains to be clarified. Cells of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae grow by budding for cell division, and the actin cytoskeleton plays a pivotal role in the budding process (Drubin, 1991). This yeast possesses the Rho family members, including RHO1 and RHO2 (Madaule et al., 1987), RHO3 and RHO4 (Matsui and Toh-e, 1992) and CDC42 (Adams et al., 1990; Johnson and Pringle, 1990). RHO1 is a homologue of the mammalian RhoA gene and we have shown that the rho1 mutants are deficient in the budding process (Yamochi et al., 1994). Moreover, immunofluorescence microscopic studies indicate that Rho1p is localized at the growth site with cortical actin patches, including the presumptive budding site, the bud tip and the cytokinesis site (Yamochi et al., 1994). These results suggest that RHO1 regulates the processes of bud formation. Concerning the downstream targets of Rho1p, we have shown that one of them is a homologue of mammalian protein kinase C, Pkc1p (Nonaka et al., 1995), which regulates cell wall integrity through the activation of the MAP kinase cascade (Levin and Errede, 1995). We have also shown that another target of Rho1p is 1,3-glucan synthase (Drgonova´ et al., 1996; Qadota et al., 1996), which is involved in cell wall synthesis. Very recently, we have identified BNI1 as a third potential target of RHO1 (Kohno et al., 1996). BNI1 (Jansen et al., 1996; Zahner et al., 1996) and its related genes in other organisms, including diaphanous (Castrillon and Wasserman, 1994) and cappuccino (Emmons et al., 1995) in Drosophila, FigA in Aspergillus (Marhoul and Adams, 1995) and fus1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Petersen et al., 1995), have been shown to be involved in cytokinesis, establishment of cell polarity, or normal cell morphology. These results suggest that Bni1p or its related proteins regulate cytoskeletal reorganization, but it has not yet been demonstrated how they do so. Structural features of Bni1p- or Bni1p-related proteins are that they contain two domains named FH1 and FH2 (Formin Homology). It should be noted that the FH1 domain 2745

consists of proline-rich sequences which have been shown to bind to the SH3 (Src Homology 3) domain (Ren et al., 1993) or profilin (Tanaka and Shibata, 1985), an actinbinding protein. Profilin has been discovered as a 15 kDa protein which is co-purified with actin monomers in a stable 1:1 complex (Carlsson et al., 1976). Profilin has since been found in all eukaryotes examined to date including yeasts, amoebae, plants, flies, frogs and mammals (Sohn and GoldschmidtClermont, 1994). In S.cerevisiae, profilin is encoded by a single gene, PFY1 (Haarer et al., 1990). Disruption of PFY1 results in the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype and the mutant cells show abnormal morphological phenotypes (Haarer et al., 1990). The in vivo function of profilin has been suggested to sequester actin monomers to protect pools of G-actin from polymerization (Carlsson et al., 1977). However, accumulating evidence suggests that profilin plays an important role in stimulating polymerization of actin rather than inhibiting it (Mockrin and Korn, 1980; Goldschmidt-Clermont et al., 1992; Carlier et al., 1993; Pantaloni and Carlier, 1993). It should be clarified how profilin is regulated and how it regulates the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. In the light of these observations, we have investigated here how the Rho1p­Bni1p system regulates the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. We show that Bni1p and its homologue, Bnr1p, directly interact with profilin to regulate the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton as targets of Rho1p and Rho4p, respectively. Results Overlapping functions of Bni1p and its homologue, Bnr1p, for cell growth Disruption of BNI1 does not show a deleterious effect on cell growth, although the bni1 mutant grows slowly at a higher temperature (Kohno et al., 1996). Searches for sequence homology to Bni1p revealed that a predicted protein of 1374 amino acids, encoded by YIL159W (DDBJ/ EMBL/GenBank accession number Z47047), is significantly homologous to Bni1p (Figure 1). YIL159W shares amino acid sequence homologies with the Rho1p-binding domain (19% identity), the FH1 domain (44% identity) and the FH2 domain (35% identity) of Bni1p, suggesting that YIL159W performs functions similar to those of Bni1p. Therefore, YIL159W was named BNR1 (BNI1Related). To characterize the BNR1 gene functionally, BNR1 was disrupted with TRP1. The bnr1 disruption mutant grew normally at 24°C, 30°C and 35°C (data not shown). The bnr1 mutant was crossed with the bni1 mutant disrupted with HIS3 and the resultant diploid was subjected to tetrad analysis. In 81 tetrads out of a total of 89 tetrads dissected, 52, 17 and 12 tetrads showed tetratype, parental ditype and non-parental ditype segregation patterns, respectively, for the His and Trp phenotypes. All of the His Trp (bni1 bnr1) segregants grew more slowly than the His­ Trp­ (wild-type), His Trp­ (bni1) or His­ Trp (bnr1) segregants at 24°C and did not grow at 33°C (data not shown), indicating that the bni1 bnr1 mutant shows a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype. This growth phenotype of the bni1 bnr1 mutant is shown in Figure 2. Therefore, BNI1 and BNR1 possess the overlapping functions for cell growth. 2746

Morphological phenotypes of the bni1 bnr1 mutant similar to those of the pfy1 mutant The bni1 bnr1 mutant cells were analysed cytologically. The bni1 bnr1 mutant cells were uniformly enlarged at the restrictive temperature (Figure 3A and B, Phase). The percentages of the budded cells in the wild-type and bni1 bnr1 mutant cell cultures, which were incubated for 8 h at 33°C, were 82% and 28% of ~300 cells examined,

respectively (data not shown). These results suggest that the enlarged cell phenotype was due to non-polar cell growth which was caused by budding deficiency. This interpretation was supported by the delocalized staining of cortical actin patches (Figure 3A, Actin) and cell wall chitin (Figure 3B, Chitin) in the bni1 bnr1 mutant cells, which are normally seen at the polarized growth sites and the bud scars, respectively. Staining of DNA revealed that there were more than two nuclei in ~60% of the bni1 bnr1 mutant cells arrested at 33°C (Figure 3A, DNA), indicating that synthesis and division of nuclear DNAs are not primarily affected in the bni1 bnr1 mutant cells. The budding pattern of the bnr1 mutant cells was random in a haploid mutant, but not in a diploid mutant (Figure 3B, Chitin), contrasting clearly with the result that the bni1 mutant shows a diploid-specific randomization of budding pattern (Figure 3B, Chitin) (Zahner et al., 1996). These phenotypes of the bni1 bnr1 mutant were very similar to those of the mutant of the PFY1 gene, which

encodes a yeast homologue of profilin (Haarer et al., 1990). Another phenotype of the pfy1 mutant is growthsensitive to 1 M sorbitol, as are some other temperaturesensitive mutants of the actin gene (ACT1) (Novick and Botstein, 1985; Haarer et al., 1990). This sorbitol-sensitive phenotype was also seen in the bni1 bnr1 mutant (Figure 4). These results suggest that there are physiological interactions between profilin and Bni1p or Bnr1p. This point was further examined genetically. The bni1 mutant was transformed with a multicopy plasmid carrying PFY1. Overexpression of PFY1 inhibited growth of the bni1 mutant, but not that of the wild-type strain (Figure 5). Although this growth inhibition was not seen in the bnr1 mutant (data not shown), this result indicates that at least BNI1 interacts genetically with PFY1. Interactions of Bni1p and Bnr1p with profilin at their FH1 domains in the yeast two-hybrid method The phenotypic similarities between the bni1 bnr1 and pfy1 mutants and the presence of proline-rich FH1 domains in Bni1p and Bnr1p suggested that Bni1p and Bnr1p interact physically with profilin. This point was examined by the yeast two-hybrid method (Fields and Song, 1989). Both Bni1p and Bnr1p indeed interacted with yeast profilin (Figure 6). The region of Bni1p or Bnr1p that interacted with profilin was delimited. Both Bni1p and Bnr1p interacted with profilin at their FH1 domains (Figure 7A and B). Direct interaction of the FH1 domain of Bni1p with profilin In the next set of experiments, it was examined whether Bni1p directly interacts with profilin. A maltose-binding

This MBP­Bni1p(1239­1650) and MBP were subjected to SDS­PAGE, blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane filter and detected by an overlay assay using the glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused yeast profilin (yeast GST­profilin) or GST. Yeast GST­profilin and GST were detected with an anti-GST antibody. GST­profilin interacted with MBP­Bni1p(1239­1650), but not with MBP (Figure 8). GST did not interact with MBP­ Bni1p(1239­1650) or MBP. GST­profilin also interacted with MBP­Bni1p(1239­1328), which contains only the FH1 domain of Bni1p (data not shown). These results indicate that profilin interacts directly with Bni1p at the FH1 domain. This direct interaction of profilin with Bni1p was further confirmed using the Bni1p-immobilized amylose resin column. The GST-fused human profilin (human GST­ profilin) (Kwiatkowski and Bruns, 1988) or GST was loaded onto an amylose resin column which was prebound 2748

to MBP­Bni1p(1239­1650) or MBP. The protein complexes were eluted with maltose and subsequently subjected to SDS­PAGE followed by protein staining. Human GST­profilin bound to MBP­Bni1p(1239­1650), but not to MBP (Figure 9A). GST did not bind to MBP­ Bni1p(1239­1650) or MBP. To confirm that GST­profilin bound specifically MBP­Bni1p(1239­1650), GST­profilin or GST was recovered from each eluate with a glutathione column and subjected to SDS­PAGE followed by protein staining. GST­profilin bound specifically to MBP­ Bni1p(1239­1650) (Figure 9B). When the amounts of GST­profilin and MBP­Bni1p(1239­1650) were quantified by densitometric tracing, it was found that ~2 mol of GST­profilin bound to 1 mol of MBP­Bni1p(1239­1650) (data not shown). We concluded that profilin directly binds to the FH1 domain of Bni1p. Bnr1p as a potential target of Rho4p The weak homology of Bnr1p to the Rho1p-binding region of Bni1p suggested that Bnr1p also interacts with Rho1p. This point was examined by the yeast two-hybrid method. Bnr1p did not interact with a dominant active Rho1p, Rho1p(Q68L), keeping Rho1p in the GTP-bound form (Bourne et al., 1991) (Table I). Therefore, it was examined whether Bnr1p interacts with other Rho family members in S.cerevisiae, including Rho2p, Rho3p, Rho4p and Cdc42p. Dominant active mutations were introduced into RHO2, RHO3, RHO4 and CDC42, and these mutant genes were cloned into a yeast two-hybrid vector along with the wild-type genes. Bnr1p did not interact with either Rho2p(Q65L), Rho2p, Rho3p(Q74L) or Rho3p (Table I). However, Bnr1p significantly interacted with Rho4p(Q70L) and Rho4p, but not with a dominant negative Rho4p, Rho4p(T25N), keeping Rho4p in the GDP-bound or nucleotide-free form (Farnsworth and Feig, 1991). In the case of CDC42, although background levels were high, significant interaction of Bnr1p with Cdc42p(Q12V) or Cdc42p was not observed. We have shown that the Rho1p-binding region of Bni1p resides in the N-terminal region which is amino acid positions from 90 to 343 (Kohno et al., 1996). The Rho4p-binding region of Bnr1p also resided in the N-terminal region which is at least amino acid positions from 63 to 421 (data not shown). This region of Bnr1p is homologous to the Rho1p-binding region of Bni1p (23% identity). These results suggest that Bnr1p is a potential target of Rho4p. Direct interaction of Bnr1p with Rho4p To investigate whether Bnr1p interacts directly with Rho4p, an MBP fused to Bnr1p(63­421) and a GST fused to Rho4p were expressed in E.coli and purified. MBP­ Bnr1p(63­421) bound to the GTPS-bound form, but not the GDP-bound form, of GST­Rho4p (Figure 10). MBP did not bind to either form of GST­Rho4p. This result indicates that Bnr1p directly interacts with the GTP-bound form of Rho4p. Discussion We have shown that Bni1p and its homologue, Bnr1p, are potential targets of the Rho family members and bind to profilin at their proline-rich FH1 domains. These results, together with the genetic results that the bni1 bnr1

Consistently, at least Rho1p (Yamochi et al., 1994) and Bni1p (Jansen et al., 1996) have been shown to be localized at a bud tip, where actin cytoskeleton seems to be actively reorganized (Drubin, 1991). Recently, Wiskott­ Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) has been shown to be involved in the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton as a target of a Rho family member, Cdc42 (Aspenstro¨m et al., 1996; Kolluri et al., 1996; Symons et al., 1996). Since WASP also has proline-rich sequences, it is interesting to clarify whether it also regulates the reorganization of the

actin cytoskeleton through profilin. Genetic studies have established that profilin plays a pivotal role for the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton (Sohn and Goldschmidt-Clermont, 1994), but the mode of action of profilin has not yet been clarified. Profilin has been shown to stimulate the dissociation of ADP from the ADP-bound form of an actin monomer to form the ATP-bound form, which polymerizes several times faster than the ADP-bound form. An additional mechanism by which profilin promotes actin polymerization has been reported (Pantaloni and Carlier, 1993). In the presence of

However, it is currently unknown whether profilin promotes filament assembly in this way in S.cerevisiae, since a homologue of thymosin 4 has not yet been discovered in S.cerevisiae. We do not know at present how Bni1p and Bnr1p are involved in this profilin­actin interaction, but the genetic results that the phenotypes of the bni1 bnr1 mutant are similar to those of the pfy1 mutant indicate that the interactions of Bni1p and Bnr1p with profilin are important for the proper functions of profilin. Another genetic result which links BNI1 with profilin is that overexpression of profilin inhibits the growth of the bni1 mutant, but not that of the bnr1 mutant or the wild-type strain.

Consistent with this, the bni1 mutant, but not the bnr1 mutant, shows a slow growth phenotype at a higher temperature. Our genetic results indicate that biochemical studies of profilin in the presence of Bni1p or Bnr1p are worth further examination. Our results indicate that Bni1p and Bnr1p regulate the functions of profilin through their proline-rich FH1 domains. Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) is a microfilament- and focal adhesion-associated protein which is concentrated in highly dynamic regions of the cell cortex (Reinhard et al., 1992). VASP has also been shown to bind to profilin through a proline-rich domain (Reinhard et al., 1995). Therefore, the proline-rich domains seem to play important roles in the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton. It is interesting to examine whether VASP also functions as a target of a Rho family member. Our results suggest that the other FH1 domain-containing proteins found in various organisms also interact with profilin. Very recently, one of these proteins, cappuccino in Drosophila, has been shown to bind to profilin in the yeast two-hybrid method (Manseau et al., 1996), although it has not been clarified whether cappuccino binds to profilin at the FH1 domain and whether it binds directly to profilin. On the other hand, the FH1 domain of formin has been shown to bind to the SH3 or WW domaincontaining proteins (Chan et al., 1996). Although it remains to be shown that these interactions are physiologically significant, if formin, like Bni1p or Bnr1p, interacts with profilin at the FH1 domain, the SH3 or WW domaincontaining proteins may regulate the interactions of the FH1 domain with profilin. Similarly, it should be examined whether the FH1 domain of Bni1p or Bnr1p interacts with an SH3 or WW domain-containing protein in S.cerevisiae. Our present conclusion that Bni1p and Bnr1p regulate the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton through profilin is consistent with the findings that FH1- and FH2-containing proteins are involved in cytokinesis or establishment of cell polarity (Castrillon and Wasserman, 1994; Emmons et al., 1995). Recently, Bni1p has been shown

to be involved in various aspects of cell polarity in S.cerevisiae. In one genetic screening, five genes, SHE1­ SHE5, have been isolated as genes needed for the accumulation in daughter nuclei of Ash1p, a repressor of HO, which is specifically transcribed in mother cells (Jansen et al., 1996). SHE5 is identical to BNI1, whereas SHE1 is identical to MYO4, which encodes a myosin motor. BNI1 may be involved in the formation of actin filaments on which Myo4p moves to bring Ash1p or a protein needed for the daughter cell-specific localization of Ash1p from the mother cell to its daughter cell. In another genetic screening, BNI1 has been identified as a mutation which causes a bipolar budding-specific randomization of budding pattern (Zahner et al., 1996). This result suggests that Bni1p is necessary for the initial localization of bipolar positional signals to the presumptive budding site. We have found that the bnr1 mutant shows an axial budding-specific randomization of budding pattern. Therefore, in contrast to Bni1p, Bnr1p seems to be necessary for the localization of axial positional signals to the presumptive budding site. In this respect, it is clear that there is a functional difference between Bni1p and Bnr1p. It would be interesting to examine whether Bni1p or Bnr1p regulates the budding pattern through the profilin­ actin system. The involvement of BNI1 and BNR1 in the control of budding patterns suggests that Rho1p and Rho4p regulate the budding patterns through Bni1p and Bnr1p, respectively. However, since Rho1p is involved in the activation of glucan synthase and Pkc1p, which are essential for cell growth, it is difficult to examine genetically whether RHO1 is involved in the control of budding pattern. In the case of RHO4, we have not observed the axial budding-specific random budding phenotype in the rho4 mutant (data not shown), suggesting that a factor other than Rho4p is involved in the Bnr1p-regulated budding pattern. This factor may be a new member of the Rho family (YNL180C, GenBank accession number Z71456), which has been revealed by the yeast genome sequencing project (data not shown). Further studies are necessary to clarify the interactions between the Rho family members and Bni1p or Bnr1p in the control of budding patterns. Bni1p and Bnr1p bind preferentially to the GTPSbound forms of Rho1p and Rho4p, respectively. Although Bni1p interacts significantly with the GDP-bound form of Rho1p (Kohno et al., 1996), the interaction of Bnr1p with the GDP-bound form of Rho4p was negligible. The

functional significance of these interactions are currently unknown. One plausible function of the Rho family members is that they bind to Bni1p or Bnr1p to bring them to the cellular sites of action such as a bud tip. This mode of action has been proposed for the function of Ras on the regulation of its target, c-Raf-1 (Leevers et al., 1994; Stokoe et al., 1994). In contrast, we and other groups have shown that the GTP-bound form of Rho1p stimulates the protein kinase activity of Pkc1p (H.Nonaka et al., unpublished results; Kamada et al., 1996) and the glucan synthase activity (Drgonova´ et al., 1996; Qadota et al., 1996). We have also shown that the GTP-bound form of Ras stimulates the protein kinase activity of B-Raf (Yamamori et al., 1995). Therefore, the Rho family members may regulate biochemical activities of Bni1p or Bnr1p, including their affinities for profilin. However, in the current study, we have used truncated forms of Bni1p which lack the Rho1p-binding domain. To examine how Rho1p regulates the interaction of Bni1p with profilin, we have attempted to purify full-length (recombinant or native) Bni1p. However, such purification has not been successful due to Bni1p's insolubility and high susceptibility to proteolysis. Further studies are required to clarify the mode of action of the Rho family members on the regulation of Bni1p and Bnr1p.

Strains, media and yeast transformations Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table II. Yeast strains were grown on rich media that contained 2% Bacto-peptone (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI), 1% Bacto-yeast extract (Difco), 0.04% adenine sulfate, 0.02% uracil and 2% glucose (YPDAU). Yeast transformations were performed by the lithium acetate methods (Gietz et al., 1992). Transformants were selected on SD medium that contained 2% glucose and 0.7% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco) and amino acids were supplemented to SD medium when required. Standard yeast genetic manipulations were performed as described (Sherman et al., 1986). An E.coli strain DH5 was used for construction and propagation of plasmids. Molecular biological techniques Standard molecular biological techniques were used for construction of plasmids, DNA sequencing and PCR (Sambrook et al., 1989). Plasmids used in this study are listed in Table III. DNA sequences were determined using ALFred DNA sequencer (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) and PCRs were performed using GeneAmp PCR System 2400 (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT). Point mutations were introduced by the PCR mutagenesis methods (Higuchi, 1989).

Disruptions of BNI1 and BNR1 BNI1 was disrupted with URA3 using a plasmid pBS-bni1::URA3 as described (Kohno et al., 1996). BNR1 was disrupted as follows. pBSbnr1::TRP1 was cut with SmaI and the digested DNA was introduced into a wild-type diploid strain OHNY3. The genomic DNA was isolated from each transformant and the proper disruption of BNR1 was verified by PCR (data not shown). A diploid strain in which one BNR1 allele was disrupted was named HIY3B and was subjected to tetrad analysis. All dissected asci (16 asci) showed a 2 Trp­: 2 Trp segregation pattern and all of the Trp clones grew normally at 24°C, 30°C and 33°C. These bnr1 mutant strains were used for further genetic studies. Cytological techniques Actin and DNA were stained with rhodamine­phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and 4 ,6 -diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO), respectively, as described (Yamochi et al., 1994). Chitin was stained with Calcofluor White M2R New (Sigma Chemical Co.) as described (Pringle, 1991). Stained cells were observed with a Zeiss Axiophoto microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and photographed with a peltier cooling 3CCD colour camera (C5810-01; Hamamatsu Photonics KK., Hamamatsu, Japan). Yeast two-hybrid method A plasmid containing a gene fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain (DBDLexA) was transformed into a yeast strain TAT7 and the resultant transformants were retransformed by a plasmid containing a gene fused to the GAL4 transcriptional activating domain (ADGAL4). Cells of each transformant were placed on the nitrocellulose filter and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl--D-galactopyranoside for -galactosidase activity as described (Vojtek et al., 1993). For quantitative assay for -galactosidase activity, cells of each transformant were cultured in SD medium lacking tryptophan and leucine and the -galactosidase activity was measured according to the ONPG assay method described (Guarente, 1983). Two-hybrid interaction was also examined by the growth phenotype of each transformant on a SD plate medium lacking tryptophan, leucine and histidine. Materials and chemicals for biochemical assays Recombinant Bni1p(1239­1650) and Bnr1p(63­421) were purified from overexpressing E.coli DH5 as MBP fusion proteins using an amylose resin column (New England BioLabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) as described (Guan et al., 1987). Recombinant yeast or human profilin and Rho4p were purified from overexpressing E.coli DH5 as GST fusion proteins using a glutathione­Sepharose 4B column (Pharmacia P-L Bio-chemicals Inc., Milwaukee, WI) as described (Kikuchi et al., 1992). The anti-GST antibody (sc-138) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA. The BA-85 (0.45 µm pore size) nitrocellulose membrane filter was purchased from Schleicher & Schuell (Dassel, Germany). Assay for the binding of recombinant Bni1p(1239­1650) with profilin MBP­Bni1p(1239­1650) or MBP (40 pmol) was subjected to SDS­ PAGE and subsequently electroblotted onto the BA-85 nitrocellulose

membrane filter. The filter was blocked overnight at 4°C in TBS (50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.5 and 200 mM NaCl) containing 5% skimmed milk and subsequently incubated for 1 h at 4°C in TBS containing 5% skimmed milk and 230 nM of yeast GST­profilin or GST. After three 5 min washes of the filter in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, the filter was incubated for 1 h at 4°C in TBS containing 5% skimmed milk and the 1000-fold diluted anti-GST antibody. After three 5 min washes of the filter in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, the filter was incubated for 1 h at 4°C with an appropriate secondary antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection with the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL). Formation of the Bni1p­profilin complex Purified human GST­profilin or GST (5 nmol) in 500 µl of buffer A (20 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT) containing 150 mM NaCl was loaded onto an amylose resin column which was prebound to MBP­Bni1p(1239­1650) (600 pmol) or MBP (1200 pmol) and the column was then washed with 20 column volumes of buffer A containing 150 mM NaCl. MBP­Bni1p(1239­1650) or MBP was eluted with 300 µl of buffer A containing 10 mM maltose and an aliquot (30 µl) of each eluate was subjected to SDS­PAGE, followed by protein staining with Coomassie brilliant blue. Another aliquot (100 µl) of each eluate was loaded onto a glutathione­Sepharose 4B column to recover GST­profilin or GST as described (Kikuchi et al., 1992). The recovered samples were subjected to SDS­PAGE, followed by protein staining with Coomassie brilliant blue. Assay for the binding of recombinant Bnr1p(63­421) with Rho4p Purified MBP­Bnr1p(63­421) or MBP (2.3 nmol) in 500 µl of buffer B (20 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT and 5 mM MgCl2) was loaded onto a glutathione­Sepharose 4B column which was prebound to the GDP- or GTPS-bound form of GST­Rho4p (2 nmol) or GST (4 nmol) and the column was then washed with 20 column volumes of buffer B. The bound proteins were subsequently eluted with 350 µl of buffer B containing 10 mM reduced glutathione and an aliquot (8 µl) of each eluate was subjected to SDS­PAGE, followed by protein staining with Coomassie brilliant blue. The GTPS- or GDP-bound form of GST­Rho4p was prepared as described (Yamamoto et al., 1990).
