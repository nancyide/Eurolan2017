The REG2 Gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Encodes a Type 1 Protein Phosphatase-Binding Protein That Functions with Reg1p and the Snf1 Protein Kinase to Regulate Growth

DEBRA L. FREDERICK1 AND KELLY TATCHELL2* Department of Genetics, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina 276951, and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Louisiana State University Medical Center, Shreveport, Louisiana 711302 Received 21 December 1995/Returned for modification 5 February 1996/Accepted 10 March 1996 The GLC7 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes the catalytic subunit of type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1) and is essential for cell growth. We have isolated a previously uncharacterized gene, REG2, on the basis of its ability to interact with Glc7p in the two-hybrid system. Reg2p interacts with Glc7p in vivo, and epitope-tagged derivatives of Reg2p and Glc7p coimmunoprecipitate from cell extracts. The predicted protein product of the REG2 gene is similar to Reg1p, a protein believed to direct PP1 activity in the glucose repression pathway. Mutants with a deletion of reg1 display a mild slow-growth defect, while reg2 mutants exhibit a wild-type phenotype. However, mutants with deletions of both reg1 and reg2 exhibit a severe growth defect. Overexpression of REG2 complements the slow-growth defect of a reg1 mutant but does not complement defects in glycogen accumulation or glucose repression, two traits also associated with a reg1 deletion. These results indicate that REG1 has a unique role in the glucose repression pathway but acts together with REG2 to regulate some as yet uncharacterized function important for growth. The growth defect of a reg1 reg2 double mutant is alleviated by a loss-of-function mutation in the SNF1-encoded protein kinase. The snf1 mutation also suppresses the glucose repression defects of reg1. Together, our data are consistent with a model in which Reg1p and Reg2p control the activity of PP1 toward substrates that are phosphorylated by the Snf1p kinase.

The reversible phosphorylation of proteins has long been recognized as a widespread mechanism of posttranslational regulation among eukaryotes. The phosphorylation state of a given protein is dependent on the relative activities of protein kinases and protein phosphatases. Early biochemical studies suggested that protein phosphatases might represent a much smaller group of enzymes than protein kinases. Whereas most kinases recognize specific motifs of five or six amino acids (46), phosphatases generally exhibit a fairly broad substrate specificity (17, 64). These data contributed to the idea that cellular signaling responses were largely determined by the activities of specific protein kinases whereas phosphatases functioned at a low constitutive level (64). Recent advances have underscored the importance of protein phosphatases in controlling physiological processes and have demonstrated that protein phosphatases are in fact highly regulated. The serine/threonine protein phosphatases are among the most conserved proteins throughout evolution. The type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1) is 80% identical in mammals and in yeasts (24, 55) and has been demonstrated to play key roles in a variety of cellular processes. In mammalian cells, PP1 regulates glycogen metabolism, muscle contractility, and protein synthesis (4, 17, 64) and has been shown to interact with the product of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (20). Studies of S. cerevisiae have likewise demonstrated multiple physiological roles for PP1, including glycogen metabolism (10, 24), sporulation (10), cell cycle progression (36, 84), chromosome segregation (27), protein synthesis (80), and glucose repression (74). The obvious question is, how does a single en-

zyme regulate so many diverse processes in so many different locations within the cell? Several years ago, Cohen and colleagues introduced the idea of regulatory or targeting subunits in response to this question (18, 43). Their hypothesis proposed that both the subcellular location and the catalytic activity of PP1 were governed by a variety of regulatory subunits that directed the phosphatase to particular locations and/or altered its activity toward particular substrates. Several examples of PP1 regulatory subunits have now been described, and the list is likely to grow. PP1 isolated from mammalian skeletal muscle is found in association with a glycogen-targeting subunit that when bound to the catalytic subunit increases the activity of PP1 toward glycogen-associated substrates (41, 42). The smooth muscle form of PP1 is a heterotrimer composed of the catalytic subunit and a regulatory complex that enhances the rate at which the smooth muscle form of PP1 dephosphorylates smooth muscle myosin (1, 19). Studies of S. cerevisiae by combined molecular and genetic approaches have led to the identification of new PP1 regulatory subunits. The GAC1 gene is required for normal glycogen accumulation in S. cerevisiae. Gac1p is most similar to the mammalian glycogen-targeting subunit from skeletal muscle (28, 69), and it physically interacts with PP1 (67). A gene in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (sds22 ) and an S. cerevisiae homolog (SDS22/EGP1), encode essential PP1-binding proteins believed to be required for the metaphase-toanaphase transition during mitosis (35, 48, 56, 66). Most recently, the REG1 gene product of S. cerevisiae has been demonstrated to bind PP1 and is proposed to direct the activity of PP1 in glucose repression (75). Glucose repression is the phenomenon in yeast cells whereby a large number of genes required for metabolism of alternate carbon sources are repressed in the presence of glucose. A previous study has reported that PP1, encoded by GLC7, is required for mainte-

nance of glucose repression (74). reg1 mutants (21, 51, 53) as well as several mutant alleles of glc7 (3, 74) are glucose derepressed. At least one of these PP1 glucose-derepressed alleles, glc7-T152K, is defective in its ability to interact with Reg1p while retaining the ability to bind the glycogen-targeting subunit (75). In this report, we describe the identification of a gene encoding a fourth PP1 regulatory subunit in S. cerevisiae. This gene, termed REG2, encodes a product with homology to Reg1p. A cDNA encoding REG2 was isolated on the basis of its interaction with PP1 in the yeast two-hybrid system. Biochemical evidence that Reg2p and PP1 interact physically is presented. Genetic data suggest that while some phenotypes associated with reg1 are not exhibited by reg2, these two gene products may nonetheless perform redundant functions important for cell growth. Finally, we present genetic evidence that Reg1p, Reg2p, and the Snf1 protein kinase function together in the same signaling pathway to regulate cell growth. MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains, media, and growth conditions. The genotypes of the S. cerevisiae strains used in this work are listed in Table 1. New alleles were introduced into the JC482 background by yeast transformation or by performing a minimum of six serial backcrosses. Yeast transformation was performed by the lithium acetate method of Gietz et al. (29). Standard yeast genetic procedures for diploid construction, tetrad analysis, and medium preparation were as described by Rose et al. (61). Escherichia coli DH5 F was used for propagation of plasmids. Yeast strains were grown in rich YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose), or synthetic medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose) supplemented with amino acids. Diploid strains were induced to sporulate on medium containing 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% acetate. For assays of galactose-inducible gene expression, strains were grown in minimal media containing 2% galactose and the appropriate amino acid supplements. 2-Deoxyglucose (2-DG) resistance was tested on synthetic media containing 2% sucrose and 200 g of 2-DG (Sigma) per ml under anaerobic conditions with GasPaks (Difco Laboratories). Control plates lacked 2-DG. Two-hybrid screen. Strains, plasmids, and cDNA library were a generous gift of Stephen Elledge. Strain Y190 was transformed with pAS-GLC7 containing the GLC7 gene fused to the Gal4p DNA binding domain in the pAS1-CYH2 vector. The resulting Trp prototrophic strain was transformed with 50 g of a cDNA library fused to the Gal4p activation domain in plasmid pACT. Transformants were selected by plating cells on synthetic medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine and containing 25 mM 3-aminotriazole. Following growth at 30 C for 5 days, transformants were replica plated to synthetic medium containing 0.4% adenine and lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. Colonies were screened for -galactosidase activity by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate- -galacto pyranoside (X-Gal; Diagnostic Chemicals Limited) filter lift assays (6). representative plates for which selection was not applied), 5 displayed various degrees of -galactosidase activity. These five blue colonies were streaked onto selective media and retested for -galactosidase activity with X-Gal. Of these, one turned a very dark blue, two turned a very light blue, and two showed no blue color at all. The three remaining positive colonies were streaked onto medium lacking uracil and containing 2.5 g of cycloheximide per ml to select for loss of pAS1-GLC7. The resulting Trp Leu strains were then mated to strain Y187 containing pAS1-X, where X represents a variety of nonspecific fusions designed to serve as negative controls. Diploids were selected by growth on medium lacking tryptophan and leucine and then screened for -galactosidase activity. Of the three pACT-cDNA clones tested, one showed strong induction of -galactosidase when mated to Y187 harboring pAS1-GLC7. Induction of -galactosidase was contingent on the presence of pAS1-GLC7, as the same strain showed

no color development when mated to Y187 harboring pAS1-SNF1, pAS1-Lamin, pAS1-p53, or pAS1-CDK2. Strains containing pACT-GAC1 and pAS1-GLC7 or pACT-SNF4 and pAS1-SNF1 served as positive controls for measuring -galactosidase activity. Plasmids containing potential interacting cDNAs were rescued from strain Y190 and transformed into E. coli DH5 F . Restriction enzyme analysis revealed two different plasmid species among 10 E. coli transformants analyzed. Following transformation into strain Y190 carrying pAS1-GLC7, clone 21-4 showed strong -galactosidase activity. This plasmid was chosen for further analysis. DNA sequencing of REG2. Restriction fragments from both the original REG2 cDNA isolated in the two-hybrid screen (clone 21-4) and a genomic clone encoding REG2 were subcloned into pBluescript SK (Stratagene Cloning Systems). Both the template and complementary strands of the REG2 open reading frame were sequenced by using a double-stranded template and Sequenase enzyme and reagents (Sequenase version 2.0; United States Biochemical Corp.). Sequencing reactions used the M13 20 and reverse primers. Custom-made oligonucleotides were used to fill internal gaps in the sequence. Synthesis of custom primers and some sequencing reactions were carried out by the Iowa State University DNA Sequencing and Synthesis Facility. A primer homologous to the Gal4p transcriptional activation domain in pACT was used to sequence through the GAL4-REG2 cDNA gene fusion, confirming that the REG2 coding sequence was in the correct reading frame. Generation of reg2::URA3, reg1::LEU2, and rna1-1 alleles. A HindIII-ApaI fragment containing the REG2 coding sequence was excised from genomic clone QJ2, a gift of Jonathan Warner (45). This fragment was subcloned into the HindIII-ApaI sites of pBluescript SK to generate plasmid pBS-REG2. A blunt end was created by digestion of pBS-REG2 with AccI followed by treatment with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Plasmid YEp24 (Stratagene), encoding the URA3 selectable marker, was similarly blunt ended by digestion with BspD1 and subsequent treatment with Klenow enzyme. Both blunt-ended plasmids were then digested with NsiI. The 1.5-kb NsiI-BspDI URA3 fragment was ligated into the NsiI-AccI sites of pBS-REG2 to generate pBS-reg2:URA3, effectively replacing the entire REG2 coding sequence with URA3. This construct was used to disrupt one of the wild-type alleles of REG2 in the diploid strain DF104. One-step gene disruption (62) was carried out by using the linear BspHI-KpnI fragment for transformation with selection on medium lacking uracil. Transformants heterozygous for the reg2::URA3 disruption were verified by genomic Southern hybridization (data not shown). To generate a reg1::LEU2 null allele, plasmid pBM1966 (a gift from Mark Johnston) was digested with PstI and then transformed into the diploid strain DF104. pBM1966 carries a LEU2 disruption of the reg1 coding sequence. Tetrad dissection of meiotic progeny from Leu transformants yielded the expected 2:2 segregation of the reg1 slow-growth phenotype. In subsequent studies, the reg1::LEU2 allele behaved identically to a reg1::URA3 disruption strain (a generous gift from Marian Carlson). Isogenic rna1-1 strains were generated by transforming strain DF104 with SstI-linearized plasmid pRU6 (rna1-1 allele) or pRU35 (RNA1 allele). These plasmids were a gift of Anita Hopper and have been described previously (72). Plasmid construction. The HindIII-XbaI fragment containing the REG2 open reading frame was subcloned into the HindIII-XbaI sites of YEp351 (33) to generate YEp-REG2. PCR amplification was used to place REG2 under control of the GAL1 promoter. Oligonucleotide primers were used to introduce BamHI sites (underlined) at the 5 (5 AAGGATCCATGTGTGAGAATGACTTTGAGT 3 ) and 3 (5 AATGGATCCT TATAGGAGCAGGTTGGGTAT3 ) ends of the REG2 open reading frame, using standard PCR conditions and Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The BamHI-REG2 fragment was ligated into the BamHI site of YCpIF15 (26) to produce YCp-Ha-REG2. In addition to being placed under GAL1 control, protein coding sequences cloned into YCpIF15 are fused to the hemagglutinin (Ha) epitope which is recognized by monoclonal antibody 12CA5. The GLC7 coding sequence was inserted into the BamHI site of pAS1-CYH2 to create an in-frame fusion protein with the Gal4p DNA binding domain. This was accomplished by PCR amplifying GLC7 with primers designed to introduce BamHI sites (underlined) at the 5 (5 -CGGGATCCGAATGGACTCAC-3 ) and 3 (5 -CGGGATCCCTAGGACGTG AATC-3 ) ends of the gene. The GAC1 coding sequence was similarly introduced into the BamHI site of pACTII, generating an in-frame fusion with the Gal4p transcriptional activation domain. GAC1 was amplified by using PCR primers designed to introduce BamHI sites (underlined) at the 5 (5 -CCGGGATCCTGGCCATGGTAATACAAACTGC TACT-3 ) and 3 ends (5 -CCGGGATCCCTCAAAGTCGCCATCGATC-3 ) of the gene. PCR amplification was performed using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Immunoprecipitation. Procedures were as described by Stuart et al. (67) except that cellular extracts were prepared from early-log-phase cultures in breaking buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and the 1,500 g spin following cell breakage was omitted. Immunoprecipitation, electrophoresis, and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (67). Invertase assays. Strains were grown to mid-log phase in selective synthetic medium containing 5% glucose. For measurements under derepressing conditions, cells were shifted to selective synthetic medium containing 0.05% glucose for 3 h. Invertase activity was assayed in whole cells as described previously (76).

Analytical procedures. Protein concentrations were determined by the procedure of Bradford (5), with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Qualitative glycogen assays were performed by inverting colonies growing on petri dishes over iodine vapor as previously described (15). Nucleotide sequence accession number. The REG2 nucleotide sequence is available through the EMBL database under accession number Z35919.

RESULTS The REG2 gene encodes a PP1-binding protein related to Reg1p. To identify new putative regulatory subunits of PP1 in S. cerevisiae, we used the yeast two-hybrid system devised by Fields and Song (25). A cDNA library fused to sequences encoding the Gal4p activation domain (amino acids 768 to 881) was coexpressed with a plasmid (pAS1-GLC7) containing the GLC7 gene encoding PP1 fused to the Gal4p DNA binding domain (amino acids 1 to 147). Positive interacting clones were identified by the ability to induce transcription of the GALregulated lacZ reporter gene. Clone 21-4, which we have since renamed pACT-REG2, repeatedly showed high -galactosidase activity. Induction of -galactosidase was dependent on the presence of pAS1-GLC7, as no color development was observed in the presence of plasmids containing nonspecific gene fusions. The GAC1-encoded glycogen regulatory subunit interacts strongly with wild-type GLC7 but is defective in its interaction with the glycogen-deficient allele, glc7-1 (67). In contrast, pACT-REG2 interacted strongly with both pAS1GLC7 and pAS1-glc7-1. Partial DNA sequence analysis followed by a BLAST search revealed that the cDNA insert in clone 21-4 was identical to a previously uncharacterized open reading frame located 366 nucleotides upstream of the REB1 locus on chromosome II. The complete gene sequence was obtained from a genomic clone (a gift of Jonathan Warner) corresponding to a 5.8-kb region of chromosome II containing REB1 (45). This gene, REG2, consists of an uninterrupted open reading frame 1,015 nucleotides in length encoding a protein product of 338 amino acids (Fig. 1). The original cDNA isolated in the two-hybrid screen was missing only the first 16 nucleotides of the REG2 coding sequence. During the course of this work, our sequence data and location of REG2 were confirmed in the published sequence of chromosome II (23) available in the databases. A BLAST search revealed that the REG2 coding sequence was most similar to that of the REG1 gene from S. cerevisiae. REG1 encodes a 1,014-amino-acid product reported to be a negative regulator of glucose-repressible genes (21, 51). In addition to its role in glucose repression, REG1 was isolated as an extragenic suppressor of rna1 mutants which are defective in both RNA processing and transport of RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (57, 79). The predicted protein products of REG1 and REG2 are 29% identical and 48% similar. The similarity extends throughout the length of Reg2p but is limited to the central half of Reg1p (residues 217 to 763) (Fig. 1). Alignment by using the Bestfit program (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, Wis.) introduced 13 gaps into the Reg1p amino acid sequence (Fig. 1A) but only 3 small gaps in the Reg2p sequence. Despite the relatively low level of similarity, we were encouraged that Reg2p was in fact a regulator of PP1 activity by a recent report demonstrating that Reg1p also associates with PP1 and may direct its role in the glucose repression pathway (75). Coimmunoprecipitation of Reg2p and PP1. To substantiate our hypothesis that REG2 encodes a PP1-binding protein, we tested the association of Reg2p and PP1 in vitro with an immunoprecipitation assay. The REG2 coding sequence was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the BamHI site of plasmid YCpIF15 (Fig. 2). Insertion of a protein-coding sequence into

FIG. 1. The predicted REG2 protein product is homologous to Reg1p. The BestFit program (Genetics Computer Group) was used to generate an alignment of the Reg1p and Reg2p amino acid (aa) sequences. Overall, the two proteins are 29% identical and 48% similar. (A) Reg1p and Reg2p are represented as bars. Regions of similarity are indicated by shading; black bars signify regions of identity. Gaps generated in the Reg1p sequence are indicated by open bars. (B) The Reg2p amino acid sequence is shown aligned to the central conserved region of Reg1p.

the multiple cloning site of YCpIF15 places protein synthesis under control of the GAL1 promoter, which drives transcription when cells are grown on galactose-containing medium but not when they are grown on glucose-containing medium. In addition, cloning of a protein-coding sequence into YCpIF15 results in the fusion of the Ha epitope tag to the amino terminus of the protein. Fusion of the Ha epitope to Reg2p did not impair function (see below). Cellular extracts from strains carrying YCp-Ha-REG2 grown under inducing conditions were analyzed by immunoblotting. Figure 3A shows that HaReg2p migrates at approximately 48 kDa. Ha-Reg2p is expressed at a level that is barely detectable in either a wild-type or a reg2 strain but is up-regulated significantly in both the reg1 and reg1 reg2 mutants (Fig. 3A; compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 4 and 5). Because of this observation, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in a reg1::URA3 background. Epitope-tagged derivatives of Reg2p (Ha-Reg2p) and PP1 (Myc-Glc7p) were precipitated with monoclonal antibodies, 12CA5 and 9E10, respectively. Construction of epitope-tagged Glc7p has been described previously (68). Immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected by immunoblotting. When Ha-Reg2p is directly precipitated with an anti-Ha antibody, a significant amount of Myc-Glc7p (migrating at 36 kDa) is coprecipitated (Fig. 3B, lane 3). Similarly, when anti-Myc antibody is used to precipitate Myc-Glc7p, a band corresponding to Ha-Reg2p is coprecipitated (Fig. 3B, lane 4). A band of 48 kDa is not observed in immunoprecipitations of Myc-Glc7p in the absence of YCp-Ha-REG2 (data not shown) and cannot be precipitated with the anti-Myc antibody from strains lacking myc-GLC7 (Fig. 3, lane 2). From these results, we conclude that Ha-Reg2p and Myc-Glc7p are physically associated in our cell extracts. REG1 and REG2 are functionally redundant. A REG2 null allele was constructed to determine whether cells require REG2 function. A diploid yeast strain was transformed with a linearized plasmid in which all but the carboxy-terminal 19 nucleotides of the REG2 coding sequence were replaced with the URA3 selectable marker (Fig. 2). The integrity of the reg2::URA3 disruption was confirmed by genomic Southern

(A) Cellular extracts were prepared from wild-type (KT1357), reg1 (DF185), reg2 (DF183), and reg1 reg2 (DF189) strains carrying either the YCpIF15 vector (lane 1) or YCp-Ha-REG2 (lanes 2 to 5). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Ha-Reg2p was detected by immunoblot analysis using an anti-Ha antibody. The position of Ha-Reg2p is indicated by the arrow. The band migrating at just over 50 kDa corresponds to a cross-reacting protein species that is present in strains lacking YCp-Ha-REG2. (B) Cellular extracts were prepared from a strain carrying either YCp-Ha-REG2 alone (DF185) or both YCp-HaREG2 and YCp-mycGLC7 (DF207). Ha-Reg2p and Myc-Glc7p were immunoprecipitated with anti-Ha and anti-Myc antibodies, respectively. Precipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then subjected to immunoblot analysis using both anti-Ha and anti-Myc antibodies. Positions of Ha-Reg2p and Myc-Glc7p are indicated by arrows.

reg2), one slowly growing Ura colony (reg1 REG2), and one pin-sized Ura colony (reg1 reg2). In every case in which there were two Ura and two Ura colonies, the Ura (REG1 REG2) spores showed normal growth whereas the Ura spores (reg1 reg2) exhibited a severe growth defect (data not shown). The reg1 reg2 double mutants were not, however, growth arrested. These cells continued to grow and divide, albeit at a much lower rate than either wild-type or reg1 single-mutant strains. Microscopic examination of reg1 reg2 double mutants revealed no gross cell morphology defects and no accumulation of cells in a specific phase of the cell cycle. To test whether overexpression of REG2 could compensate for loss of reg1, plasmid YCp-Ha-REG2 was transformed into both reg1 and reg1 reg2 mutant strains. This construct, containing REG2 under control of the GAL1 promoter, complemented the growth defect of reg1::URA3 and reg1::URA3 reg2::URA3 strains when grown on galactose but not glucose (Fig. 5A). We conclude that overexpression of REG2 complements the slow-growth phenotype of both reg1::URA3 single mutants and reg1::URA3 reg2::URA3 double mutants, suggesting that REG1 and REG2 are functionally related. Overexpression of REG2 has no effect on the glucose derepression, glycogen hyperaccumulation, and rna1-1 suppression phenotypes of a reg1 mutant. REG1 was originally identified on the basis of its role in carbohydrate metabolism and is thought to encode a negative regulator of glucose-repressible genes. Strains harboring a reg1::URA3 disruption allele express

hybridization analysis (data not shown). Sporulation and tetrad analysis of meiotic progeny from the resulting reg2::URA3/ REG2 heterozygous diploid revealed no observable traits associated with loss of REG2 function. The reg2 null mutants grew normally at temperatures ranging from 11 to 37 C and on a variety of growth media, including 2% ethanol and glycerol, 0.9 M NaCl, 8 mM caffeine, or 10 g of benomyl per ml. Additionally, the reg2::URA3 mutants were normal with respect to glycogen accumulation, glucose repression, and sporulation. However, when a reg2::URA3 haploid strain was mated to a strain carrying a reg1::LEU2 null allele, the resulting Ura Leu double mutants exhibited a severe growth defect (Fig. 4A). While reg1 single mutants have a slightly smaller colony size on plates in our strain background, the reg1::URA3 reg2::LEU2 double mutants formed pin-sized colonies not visible in Fig. 4A. The same result was seen in experiments in which both reg1 and reg2 were disrupted with URA3. Sporulation of a reg1::URA3/REG1 reg2::URA3/REG2 heterozygous diploid yielded tetratypes consisting of one normal-sized Ura colony (REG1 REG2), one normal-sized Ura colony (REG1

a Two independent transformants from each strain were grown to mid-log

phase in selective synthetic medium containing 5% glucose (repressing conditions). Aliquots were shifted to selective synthetic medium containing 0.05% glucose (derepressing conditions) and grown for an additional 3 h.

FIG. 5. Overexpression of REG2 complements the growth defect of a reg1 mutant but has no effect on the glycogen hyperaccumulation phenotype. (A) Plasmid YCp-Ha-REG2, containing the REG2 coding sequence under control of the GAL1 promoter, was transformed into a wild-type strain (KT1357), a reg1 mutant (DF185), or a reg1 reg2 double mutant (DF189). The resulting transformants are pictured following growth for 2 days at 37 C (a temperature at which the growth defect of a reg1 mutant is exacerbated) on medium containing either 2% glucose or 2% galactose. (B) Both wild-type (DF103) and reg1::URA3 (DF173) strains were transformed with either an empty vector (YEp351) or a high-copy-number REG2 plasmid (YEp-REG2). To assay glycogen accumulation, transformants were streaked onto selective medium, grown for 2 days at 30 C, and then stained with iodine vapor.

invertase, a glucose-repressible enzyme, at a constitutively high level (54). Wild-type strains, on the other hand, express invertase poorly when grown on glucose. To determine if overexpression of REG2 could complement the glucose-derepressed phenotype of reg1 mutants, invertase activity was measured in a reg1::URA3 strain carrying either a high-copy-number REG2 plasmid (YEp-REG2) or a control vector (YEp351). Qualitative analysis of glucose derepression was also carried out by streaking the identical strains onto sucrose plates containing 2-DG. 2-DG is a glucose analog which stimulates glucose repression but cannot be metabolized. As a result, only strains that are glucose derepressed are able to utilize sucrose in the presence of 2-DG. From these experiments, we conclude that overexpression of REG2 does not abrogate the glucose-derepressed phenotype of a reg1 mutant. Even in the presence of a high-copy-number REG2 plasmid, a reg1 deletion strain maintains high invertase activity (Table 2) and remains 2-DG resistant (data not shown). In addition to the slow-growth and glucose derepression phenotypes associated with reg1 null mutants, we and others (39, 75) observed that these strains hyperaccumulate glycogen. Qualitative glycogen measurements are made by inverting a petri plate over iodine crystals. Wild-type colonies stain medium brown within 1 to 2 min, while strains deficient in glycogen accumulation remain yellow. We consistently observed that reg1 disruption strains turn a dark brown color within 5 to 10 s after being inverted over iodine, while wild-type colonies remain unstained during the same time period. To test whether overexpression of REG2 was able to complement the glycogen hyperaccumulation phenotype of a reg1 null strain, a reg1:: URA3 strain was transformed with either YEp-REG2 or a control vector (YEp351). Figure 5B shows the resulting trans-

formants alongside wild-type strains carrying the identical plasmids following exposure to iodine crystals. The wild-type strain stains a yellow-light brown color irrespective of the REG2 plasmid, whereas the reg1::URA3 strain stains a very dark brown within the same time period (Fig. 5B). The reg1::URA3 strain harboring plasmid YEp-REG2 accumulates glycogen at levels comparable to those for the identical strain carrying an empty vector. glc7-1 encodes an allele of the PP1 catalytic subunit, the distinguishing feature of which is a dramatic glycogen deficiency (10, 28, 58). The glycogen hyperaccumulation phenotype of reg1, which encodes a predicted subunit of PP1, prompted us to assay glycogen levels in a reg1 glc7-1 double mutant. Crosses between reg1 and glc7-1 strains reveal that the double mutants accumulate an intermediate level of glycogen (data not shown). However, glc7-1 does not suppress the colony size defect of reg1, and subsequent crosses to a reg2 strain reveal that glc7-1 does not suppress the severe growth defect of the reg1 reg2 double mutants (data not shown). Along with the proposed role of REG1 as a negative regulator of glucose-repressible genes, reg1 mutants have been demonstrated to suppress RNA processing defects and temperature-sensitive growth of rna1-1 and prp mutants (49, 57, 79). The RNA1 gene encodes a cytosolic protein (38) shown to affect pre-tRNA and pre-tRNA processing (37, 47) as well as transport of RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (2, 44, 65). The PRP genes affect pre-mRNA processing, and several have been found to encode splicing factors or components of spliceosomes (63). Given that Reg1p and Reg2p may perform redundant functions, we tested whether overexpression of REG2 might abolish reg1 suppression of rna1-1. We reasoned that if defects associated with rna1-1 mutants were suppressed by loss of reg1 function, then overexpression of the functionally related REG2 gene might prevent suppression. Nonetheless, a reg1::URA3 rna1-1 double mutant (strain DF205) carrying REG2 on a high-copy-number plasmid (YEp-REG2) was able to maintain growth at the nonpermissive temperature of 34 C (data not shown). Together, the genetic data suggest that while REG1 and REG2 appear to have overlapping functions with respect to regulation of cell growth, important distinctions remain. Only reg1 mutants are defective in glucose repression and glycogen

metabolism. Overexpression of REG2 in a reg1 deletion strain complements the slow-growth defect but does not compensate for defects in glucose repression or glycogen accumulation. Furthermore, overexpression of REG2 has no effect on the ability of reg1 to suppress rna1-1. The severe growth defect of reg1 reg2 double mutants is suppressed by a Snf1 protein kinase mutant. Mutants in the SNF1-encoded protein kinase are unable to activate glucoserepressible genes (13, 14). In previous investigations, it was reported that snf1 reg1 double mutants exhibit the glucoserepressed phenotype of snf1 rather than the derepressed phenotype of reg1 (54, 78). To determine if the growth defect associated with reg1 reg2 was also suppressed by snf1, we first crossed a snf1 mutant to a reg1::LEU2 mutant. For these experiments, we used snf1-172, an allele previously shown to behave very similar to a null allele (70). As previously reported, snf1 was epistatic to reg1. The snf1 reg1 double mutants had reduced glycogen levels and failed to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources, both hallmarks of a snf1 null mutant (70). A snf1 reg2::URA3 mutant was then crossed to a reg1::LEU2 strain. Tetrad analysis of meiotic progeny from the resulting diploid are presented in Fig. 4B. Tetrads were replica plated to medium lacking uracil and medium lacking leucine as well as to YPEG to score the snf1 genotype. Surprisingly, many of the Leu Ura progeny grew into normal-sized colonies. Tetrad analysis of 25 asci revealed that 14 reg1::LEU2 reg2::URA3 spore clones grew into normal-sized colonies. All 14 were snf1172, as determined by their failure to grow on YPEG and accumulate glycogen. Another 14 spore clones either failed to germinate or grew very slowly, and 12 of these were deduced unambiguously to be reg1 reg2 SNF1 mutants. Mutations in snf1 as well as in components of the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase pathway have been found to affect some of the same physiological processes (31, 40, 70, 78). A snf1 null mutant is unable to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources, is sensitive to heat stress and starvation, and fails to accumulate glycogen in response to nutrient depletion (31, 70). These phenotypes resemble those commonly associated with a hyperactive adenylate cyclase pathway. Mutations in adenylate cyclase (CYR1/CDC35), which decrease the level of cAMP in the cell, moderate the snf1 phenotype. In contrast, mutations in the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (BCY1), which increase cAMP-dependent protein kinase levels, exacerbate the snf1 phenotype (70). Together, the glucose repression and cAMPadenylate cyclase pathways control the cell's response to glucose availability, ultimately affecting a large number of gene products involved in growth control (7, 60). Curiously, suppression of rna1-1 by reg1 is mediated by both of these signaling pathways. Mutations in either snf1 or bcy1 abolish suppression of rna1-1 by reg1 (78). Given the relationship between REG1, SNF1, and the cAMP pathway, we were interested to see how mutations in either cdc35 or bcy1 might affect the growth of reg1 reg2 double mutants. A reg1::URA3 disruption strain was crossed to a temperature-sensitive cdc35-13 mutant. The cdc35-13 allele was chosen because it exhibits a partial growth defect at the semipermissive temperature of 30 C (59). Approximately one-quarter of the spores failed to grow into macroscopic colonies after 4 to 5 days of growth at 24 C. Tetrads were replica plated to synthetic medium and incubated at 37 C to score for temperature sensitivity and to medium lacking uracil to score the reg1::URA3 genotype. From over 50 tetrads analyzed, 95% of wild-type, cdc35-13, or reg1::URA3 spore clones grew into colonies. However, cdc35-13 reg1::URA3 double-mutant spores either failed to germinate or germinated and divided a few times before arresting as microcolonies. No growth defect was observed when the cdc35-13 mutant was crossed to a reg2:: URA3 strain. The lethality of reg1 cdc35-13 mutants indicates that reg1 mutants are sensitive to reduced levels of intracellular cAMP. Since the major and possibly only physiological role of cAMP is to activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK), it is likely that reg1 mutants are sensitive to reduced cAPK activity. One explanation for the synthetic lethality of cdc35-13 and reg1 is that reg1 and possibly reg2 are positive regulators of adenylate cyclase or cAPK. If this is so, we reasoned that traits associated with a reg1 and/or reg2 deficiency might be ameliorated by increased activity of cAPK. BCY1 encodes the regulatory subunit of cAPK, and loss-of-function mutations in bcy1 bypass the requirement for adenylate cyclase and its activators, resulting in constitutively active cAPK (8, 50, 71, 81). We first crossed a reg1::URA3 strain to a strain carrying bcy1-16, an ochre nonsense mutation that results in a truncated BCY1 peptide after amino acid 344 (9). The resulting reg1::URA3 bcy1-16 double mutant, which retained the slow-growth phenotype of the reg1::URA3 BCY1 strain, was then crossed to a reg2::URA3 mutant, and the resulting diploid was subjected to tetrad analysis. The reg1 reg2 double mutants grew extremely slowly irrespective of the bcy1 genotype (data not shown). Thus, the slow growth rate of the reg1 reg2 strain is not suppressed by increased activity of cAPK. Together, these data indicate that the slow growth rate of the reg1 reg2 strain is not due to a defect in activation of adenylate cyclase and suggest that reg1 and cAPK act on the same physiological pathways but do so independently. DISCUSSION Here we describe a previously uncharacterized gene, REG2, whose product has 29% amino acid identity and 48% similarity with Reg1p. We present evidence that like Reg1p, Reg2p interacts with the GLC7-encoded PP1 both in vivo, as assayed by the two-hybrid system, and in vitro, as assayed by coimmunoprecipitation. Genetic analysis reveals that while disruption of either reg1 or reg2 alone results in a relatively mild slow-growth phenotype (reg1) or no defect at all (reg2), disruption of both reg1 and reg2 causes a severe growth defect. Both the slowgrowth defect of a reg1 mutant and the severe growth defect of a reg1 reg2 double mutant are complemented by overexpression of REG2, indicating these two genes are functionally related. Finally, we demonstrate that the severe growth defect associated with a reg1 reg2 double mutant can be rescued by a mutant allele of the Snf1 protein kinase. The role of the REG1 gene product as a negative regulator of glucose-repressible genes is well established (51, 54, 85). However, the pleiotropic phenotype of a reg1 null mutant suggest that Reg1p may have other roles within the cell. This idea is consistent with our results suggesting that Reg1p and Reg2p perform redundant functions distinct from glucose repression. Overexpression of REG2 suppresses the slow-growth defect of a reg1 mutant but not the defect in glucose repression. Because reg2 mutants themselves are not glucose derepressed, it seems improbable that the severe growth defect of the reg1 reg2 double mutants is a direct result of defects in glucose repression. An alternative explanation is that Reg1p and Reg2p function together to direct PP1 activity in an as yet undetermined pathway controlling cell growth. Given that the sequence similarity between Reg1p and Reg2p is confined to central half (amino acids 217 to 763) of Reg1p, it seems likely that these sequences contain domains important for general growth regulation as well as the binding domain for PP1. The unconserved amino-

terminal and/or carboxy-terminal regions of Reg1p might comprise regulatory domains required for directing PP1 activity specifically to substrates in the glucose repression pathway. If the growth defect of the reg1 reg2 double mutant is the result of decreased PP1 activity, it seems logical that this defect could be compensated for by a mutation in an opposing protein kinase. Precedent for this type of antagonistic relationship has been reported for two other protein kinases and PP1 in S. cerevisiae. GCN2 encodes a protein kinase that phosphorylates the subunit of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2 ) in response to amino acid starvation. Phosphorylation of eIF2 leads to increased expression of Gcn4p, a transcription factor with a central role in the general amino acid control pathway (34). A dominant negative glc7 mutant, caused by deletion of the C-terminal 104 amino acid residues of Glc7p, restores GCN4 expression in strains containing a mutant gcn2-encoded kinase (80), consistent with the hypothesis that eIF2 is dephosphorylated by Glc7p. Another example involves the IPL1encoded protein kinase that is required for chromosome segregation during mitosis. The temperature sensitivity of the ipl1-1 allele can be partially suppressed by expression of another C-terminal deletion of glc7, by glc7-1, or by a mutation in glc8, a potential modulator of Glc7p (27, 77). In contrast, hyperexpression of Glc7p in wild-type strains leads to a loss in fidelity in chromosome segregation (27). Together, these results indicate that PP1 acts in opposition to Ip11p and suggests that the Ip11 kinase and PP1 may act on the same substrate(s). A similar scenario can be proposed for Reg1p and Reg2p in which the growth defect of reg1 reg2 mutants is caused by the failure of PP1 to dephosphorylate a substrate or substrates important for growth regulation. The hyperphosphorylation of these putative substrates in reg1 reg2 mutants could be reversed by reducing the activity of the opposing protein kinase. Several lines of evidence implicate Snf1p as the kinase acting in opposition to Reg1p and Reg2p. First, snf1 mutants exhibit traits that are opposite those observed for reg1 mutants. snf1 mutants are unable to induce glucose-repressed genes and fail to accumulate glycogen. In contrast, reg1 mutants are constitutively glucose derepressed and hyperaccumulate glycogen. Second, a snf1 mutation is epistatic to reg1 and to the severe growth defect of reg1 reg2. The ability of increased expression of Reg2p to suppress the growth defect of reg1 but not its glucose derepression phenotype suggests that distinct substrates are involved in growth-related and glucose repression defects. In our model, Snf1p would be responsible for phosphorylating the target substrates for both Reg1p- and Reg2p-associated PP1. The importance of the SNF1-encoded protein kinase in relieving glucose repression is well established (53, 60, 73). However, not unlike reg1 and glc7 mutants, snf1 mutants exhibit pleiotropic phenotypes including the inability to grow on nonglucose carbon sources, sensitivity to starvation and heat stress, failure to accumulate glycogen, and sporulation defects (70). These data are consistent with the idea that in addition to its role in glucose repression, Snf1p may regulate other cellular processes. Supporting this hypothesis are reports that Snf1p is present in both glucose-repressed and derepressed cells and appears to be distributed throughout the cell (14). Recent evidence indicates that Snf1p and the related mammalian AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) may regulate a variety of metabolic pathways. Snf1p shows a remarkable degree of sequence identity (46%) to both mammalian AMPK and a protein kinase encoded by the RKIN1 gene from rye (12). Expression of cRKIN1 in yeast snf1 mutants restores SNF1 function (12), indicating Snf1p, AMPK, and RKIN1 form a conserved family of protein kinases. Mammalian AMPK functions in lipid metabolism, negatively regulating acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) carboxylase (52), the enzyme catalyzing the first committed step in fatty acid synthesis. In a wild-type yeast strain, acetyl-CoA carboxylase undergoes a time-dependent decrease in activity when glucose is limiting (82). In snf1 mutants, acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity remains high (82), suggesting that like its mammalian homolog, Snf1p may inactivate acetyl-CoA carboxylase in vivo. The proposed role of Snf1p in lipid metabolism is consistent with the idea that Snf1p may be involved in a wide range of metabolic pathways. It is of interest that mammalian acetyl-CoA carboxylase and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, both of which are in vivo substrates of AMPK (30, 52), are dephosphorylated by PP1 in vitro (16, 32). Alternative models for the antagonistic behavior of snf1 and reg1/reg2 cannot be ruled out at this time. Reg1p and Reg2p might negatively regulate Snf1p directly or could regulate a component of a Snf1p-protein complex such that the growth defect of the double mutant is the result of increased Snf1p kinase activity. Among the potential substrates for this type of regulation are members of a family of functionally related proteins involved in glucose repression. This group includes Sip1p, Sip2p, and Gal83p, which associate with Snf1p and are phosphorylated in a SNF1-dependent manner (83). gal83 mutants exhibit reduced Snf1p activity in vitro (83), and genetic evidence suggests that Reg1p and Gal83p act together (22). In this model, Reg1p and Reg2p would be predicted to have qualitatively different effects on Snf1p activity, since overexpression of Reg2p alleviates the growth defect of reg1 without influencing its glucose derepression phenotype.
