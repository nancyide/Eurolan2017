Exonuclease I of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Functions in Mitotic Recombination In Vivo and In Vitro

PAOLA FIORENTINI,1 KIMBERLY N. HUANG,1 DANIEL X. TISHKOFF,2 RICHARD D. KOLODNER,2 AND LORRAINE S. SYMINGTON1* Institute of Cancer Research and Department of Microbiology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032,1 and Charles A. Dana Division of Human Cancer Genetics, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 021152 Received 9 September 1996/Accepted 24 February 1997 We previously described a 5 -3 exonuclease required for recombination in vitro between linear DNA molecules with overlapping homologous ends. This exonuclease, referred to as exonuclease I (Exo I), has been purified more than 300-fold from vegetatively grown cells and copurifies with a 42-kDa polypeptide. The activity is nonprocessive and acts preferentially on double-stranded DNA. The biochemical properties are quite similar to those of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Exo I. Extracts prepared from cells containing a mutation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae EXO1 gene, a homolog of S. pombe exo1, had decreased in vitro recombination activity and when fractionated were found to lack the peak of activity corresponding to the 5 -3 exonuclease. The role of EXO1 on recombination in vivo was determined by measuring the rate of recombination in an exo1 strain containing a direct duplication of mutant ade2 genes and was reduced sixfold. These results indicate that EXO1 is required for recombination in vivo and in vitro in addition to its previously identified role in mismatch repair.

The currently favored models for homologous recombination predict a requirement for nucleases at several steps in the recombination reaction (18, 37, 55). Endonucleases are envisioned to function as initiators of recombination and in the resolution of crossed-strand intermediates. Exonucleases are thought to process break sites to generate single-stranded DNA, the substrate for binding by homologous pairing proteins. Late steps in the reaction, such as the repair of heteroduplex DNA (mismatch correction), also require the activity of exonucleases. The importance of exonucleases in recombination has been clearly demonstrated in Escherichia coli, in which 5 -to-3 exonucleases are required for all homologous recombination pathways (30). In addition, the single-stranded exonucleases RecJ (5 ), exonuclease VII (Exo VII) (5 and 3 ), and Exo I (3 ) are required for mismatch repair in vitro (8). In vivo studies of double-strand break (DSB) repair in Saccharomyces cerevisiae provide further support for the role of exonucleases in recombination. After HO endonuclease cleavage at the MAT locus during mating-type switching, the DNA is resected to produce a 3 tail on the distal side of the HO cut site (64). This single-strand tail is believed to invade the donor locus, thus initiating the transfer of information. Formation of the 3 single-stranded tail is thought to result from the activity of a double-stranded 5 -3 exonuclease, but it could arise from the combined activities of a helicase and single-stranded endonuclease or exonuclease (35). Although mutation of several known recombination genes prevents mating-type switching, none appears to block the exonucleolytic processing step (49, 64). However, the degradation of the 5 strand is slower in rad50 and xrs2 mutants, suggesting that these genes may encode or regulate the activity of a nuclease (21). Most meiotic

recombination hot spots are cleaved by endonucleases during meiosis, and the resulting DSBs are processed to leave 3 single-strand tails (5, 50). An allele of the RAD50 gene called rad50S prevents this degradation and also prevents further progression through meiosis (1). Thus, the 3 tails generated by the processing of DSB sites are essential intermediates in meiotic recombination. The failure of meiotic DSBs to be processed in rad50S mutants appears to result from the covalent attachment of a protein to the 5 ends at the break site (10, 25, 32). Several 5 -3 exonuclease activities have been identified in extracts of S. cerevisiae (3, 4, 7, 9, 12, 62). The genes encoding two of these activities, NUC1 and SEP1, have been cloned (58, 65). Nuc1 is a mitochondrial protein that is tightly associated with the inner membrane (9). Sep1 is an abundant protein that catalyzes DNA strand exchange in vitro (29), is a potent 5 -3 exoribonuclease, and displays weak exo-DNase activity (23, 48). Although Sep1 has the expected in vitro activity for a protein that could be involved in processing DSB sites and utilizing the 3 tail in a strand exchange reaction, sep1 mutants are proficient at mating-type switching and undergo exonucleolytic processing of meiotic DSBs (2, 59). These results suggest that another exonuclease is responsible for the processing observed at DSB sites in vivo or that there is functional redundancy for this activity. The Rad2 protein, which acts endonucleolytically during nucleotide excision repair, has a weak 5 -3 exonuclease activity (14). However, the phenotypes of rad2 mutants, such as resistance to ionizing radiation and normal levels of recombination, are inconsistent with this nuclease playing a major role in recombinational repair. A protein with homology to Rad2, identified through the chromosome XI sequencing project (22) and subsequently called Rad27, Rth1, or Erc11 (40, 47, 61), also has 5 -3 exonuclease activity (17). For simplicity, this protein is referred to as Rad27 in this report. The mammalian homolog of Rad27 was identified as an exonuclease required to complete lagging-strand DNA synthesis in vitro (13, 26, 60, 63) and as the structurespecific endonuclease FEN-1 (16, 17). Rad27 is proposed to be

the functional and structural homolog of the 5 -3 exonuclease domain of E. coli DNA polymerase I (40, 47). Analysis of the completed DNA sequence of S. cerevisiae identified three other open reading frames (ORFs) encoding proteins with homology to Rad2. These include DHS1 (ORF YOR033C, chromosome XI), DIN7 (ORF YDR263C, chromosome IV), and YEN1 (ORF YER041W, chromosome V). The DHS1 gene was originally identified by genetic complementation of a drughypersensitive mutant (31). However, the protein sequence of Dhs1 (GenBank accession number S69545) is 219 amino acids shorter than the ORF identified by the S. cerevisiae genome sequencing project, and most of the conserved nuclease motifs are found within these 219 amino acids. Dhs1 was also identified as a protein that interacts with the mismatch recognition protein Msh2 (57), and Dhs1 shows higher homology to Schizosaccharomyces pombe Exo I (see below) than to Rad2 or Rad27. Because of the high homology between the complete Dhs1 sequence and S. pombe Exo I, the Dhs1 protein has been renamed S. cerevisiae Exo1 (57). Two 5 -3 exonucleases have been purified and characterized from S. pombe. Exo I is double-strand specific and is induced during meiosis (52). exo1 mutants display increased rates of spontaneous mutation and increased meiotic intragenic recombination between close markers, two phenotypes consistent with a role in mismatch correction (53). The sequence of Exo I shows considerable homology to both Rad2 and Rad27 of S. cerevisiae, indicating that Exo I is part of the superfamily of eukaryotic proteins with homology to the 5 -3 exonuclease domain of prokaryotic Pol I proteins, T4 RNase H, T5 exonuclease D15, T7 gene 6 exonuclease, and E. coli RecJ (33, 38, 53). A Drosophila homolog of S. pombe Exo I was recently identified as a gene that is specifically expressed in the female germ line (11). Exo II of S. pombe acts preferentially on single-stranded DNA and appears to be a homolog of the S. cerevisiae Sep1 protein (24, 54). In previous work aimed at developing an in vitro system for recombination in S. cerevisiae, we identified a 5 -3 exonuclease that was required for an end-joining reaction and for the formation of joint molecules between two linear duplexes that had a region of overlapping terminal homology (20, 51). Because this activity was undiminished in cell extracts prepared from a strain containing mutations in the NUC1 and SEP1 genes, we concluded that it was distinct from these previously characterized exonucleases. In this report, we describe the purification and properties of this exonuclease and provide evidence that it is the product of the EXO1 gene, a homolog of S. pombe Exo I. Furthermore, we show that recombination between repeated sequences is reduced in exo1 mutants. MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains and genetic methods. The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are derivatives of W303-1A or W303-1B (Table 1). Strains LSY346-3A and LSY3645A, containing disruptions of the SEP1, NUC1, and PEP4 genes, have been described previously (20). Strain LSY380 was constructed by one-step replacement (41) of W303-1B with a PCR fragment to generate a deletion-disruption allele of RAD2. PCR was performed on a TRP1-containing template (pRS404) with the primers 5 -GAAGGTTCTACACGTCATCCATGAAGAAAAGCATT TTCGGGAGAAggtcgaaaaaagaaaaggaga-3 and 5 -TCATACCTCACCGACG CAAAGATACCAAAAGGACCGTATATATCTatgcttgcttttcaaaaggcc-3 . Uppercase bases represent RAD2 sequences, and lowercase bases correspond to TRP1 sequences. Trp transformants that showed sensitivity to UV light were analyzed by Southern hybridization to verify disruption of the RAD2 gene. The resulting rad2::TRP1 allele has had the entire RAD2 ORF replaced by the TRP1 gene. The diploid that resulted from crossing LSY380 to LSY346-3A was sporulated, and tetrads were dissected to identify haploid segregants (LSY381-3A and LSY381-13C) that contained the rad2, sep1, pep4, and nuc1 deletion alleles. Strain LSY486-2A was generated by transformation of W303-1B with a DNA

fragment containing rad27::URA3, derived from plasmid pMRrad27 ::URA3 (40). Ura transformants that showed a temperature-sensitive growth defect and sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate were analyzed by Southern blotting to verify disruption of the RAD27 gene and then were backcrossed to W303-1A. Strain LSY486-2A was crossed to strain LSY346-3A, and segregants that contained the rad27::URA3 allele, in addition to sep1, pep4, and nuc1 mutations, were identified among the haploid progeny generated by sporulation and tetrad analysis. Strain LSY485 was constructed by one-step replacement of a W303 diploid strain with a PCR fragment to generate a deletion-disruption allele of YEN1. PCR was performed on a HIS3-containing template DNA (pRS403) with the primers 5 -GGTCCATCCAATGAAATGACAGTTCTATTGCATTTTAC CTACTTGTATgtgagcgctaggagtcactg-3 and 5 -CAACTGTGGTGGCGGATT TTTTGACGCTGTGCCCGTTAACTCATTCAAggaaagcgcgcctcgttcag-3 . Uppercase bases represent YEN1 sequences, and lowercase bases represent HIS3 sequences. His transformants were screened by PCR analysis of genomic DNA with primers complementary to sequences within the HIS3 gene and 3 to the disruption of the YEN1 locus. The resulting yen1::HIS3 allele has had the entire YEN1 coding region replaced by the HIS3 gene. This diploid was sporulated, and tetrads were dissected to obtain haploid segregants containing the yen1::HIS3 allele. Strain LSY485-2C was crossed to LSY346-5A, and the resulting diploid was sporulated to obtain haploid segregants that contained the yen1::HIS3, sep1::URA3, nuc1::LEU2, and pep4::LEU2 alleles (LSY495-14A). Strain LSY492, containing a disruption of the EXO1 gene, was made in two steps as follows. First, an exo1 deletion strain (RKY2662) was made by transformation of RKY2321 with a PCR-amplified DNA fragment containing EXO1 gene sequences bordering the HIS3 gene. This fragment was constructed by amplification of the HIS3 gene present in pPS729 (P. Silver, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute) by PCR with primers 22244 (5 -AAAGGAGCTCGAAAAAACTGAAAG GCGTAGAAAGGAATGGGTATCCAAGGTggcctcctctagtacactc) and 21964 (5 -CCTCCGATATGAAACGTGCAGTACTTAACTTTTATTTACCTTTAT AAACAAATTGGGgcgcgcctcgttcagaat). Uppercase bases represent EXO1 sequences, and lowercase bases represent HIS3 sequences. In this strain, residues 6 to 695 of the EXO1 ORF were replaced with the HIS3 gene. This disruption was then introduced into LSY346-5A by transformation with a DNA fragment containing the HIS3 gene bordered by several hundred base pairs of EXO1 sequence; this fragment was generated by PCR with the primers 22388 (5 -CC GGCCCGAGAAGGAGAAGTA) and 22237 (5 -TGCGGAGAATAAAAGGT TGTGACG) and genomic RKY2662 DNA as the template. The correct integration of the exo1::HIS3 allele in strain LSY492 was verified by PCR analysis of genomic DNA preparations with primers complementary to sequences in EXO1 and HIS3. Strain LSY492 was crossed to YKH19a to generate haploid progeny containing the exo1::HIS3 allele (LSY496-10D and LSY496-20A). Strain LSY509 was constructed by one-step replacement of strain LSY496-10D with a PCR fragment to generate a deletion-disruption allele of DIN7. A LEU2-containing DNA template (pRS405) was used for PCR with the primers 5 -ATTCGATAG GAATGGGAATACCTGGCTTACTGCCTCAATTctcgaggagaacttctagta-3 and 5 -GGTACGGTGCCTGAGATCGCTGCTGGTGAGGTCATATAAAtcg actacgtcgtaaggccg-3 . Uppercase bases represent DIN7 sequences, and lowercase bases represent LEU2 sequences. Leu transformants were screened by PCR analysis of genomic DNA with primers complementary to sequences internal to the LEU2 gene and to sequences downstream of the disruption at the DIN7 locus. The disruption alleles of YEN1 and DIN7 made by the PCR method were also verified by Southern hybridization analysis. The resulting din7::LEU2 allele has had residues 11 to 413 of the 430-residue ORF replaced by the LEU2 gene. Strain LSY509 was crossed to strain LSY346-5A, the resulting diploid was sporulated, and the tetrads were dissected to obtain haploid segregants that contained the din7::LEU2, sep1::URA3, nuc1::LEU2, and pep4::LEU2 alleles. Strain YKH19a, containing a direct repeat of mutant ade2 genes, was used to measure recombination rates. One repeat contains a 3 truncation of the ade2 gene, and the other contains a truncation of the 5 end. The repeats are separated by pRS306 vector sequences, including the URA3 gene. This strain was made by transformation of strain YKH10a (19) with plasmid pKH11C, which had been digested with the restriction endonuclease BglII, and selection for Ura transformants. The structure of the resulting Ura Ade transformants was confirmed by Southern analysis. Strain YKH19a was crossed to LSY492, and after tetrad analysis of the resulting diploids, haploid segregants containing the ade2 recombination reporter and the exo1::HIS3 allele were identified (LSY49616D and LSY496-19B). LSY496-16D was crossed to a rad1 rad52 strain (W83819C), and haploid segregants containing the ade2 recombination reporter and combinations of the exo1, rad1, and rad52 alleles were identified by phenotype. Transformation of yeast cells and sporulation and dissection of diploid strains were performed as described previously (45). E. coli DH5 was used for propagation of plasmids, and strain JM109 was used for propagation of M13 derivatives. Plasmids. The plasmid used to generate the direct repeat of mutant ade2 genes was constructed as follows. First, pKH5, which contains a 3.6-kb BglII fragment containing ADE2 cloned into the BamHI site of pRS314, was digested with AatII and PstI. The resulting overhangs were removed by digestion with T4 DNA polymerase, and the plasmid was then circularized by ligation. The resulting plasmid was digested with NdeI and EagI, and the resulting 3 recessed ends were filled with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and then ligated. The resulting plasmid, pKH10, had the 947-bp internal fragment of the ADE2 gene

Rich medium (yeast extract-peptone-dextrose [YEPD]) and synthetic complete (SC) medium with bases and amino acids omitted as specified were used as described previously (45). Yeast strains were grown at 30 C unless otherwise indicated. Strains with RAD27 deleted were grown at 23 C. Enzymes. Restriction endonucleases, the E. coli DNA polymerase I large fragment, calf intestinal phosphatase, and T4 polynucleotide kinase were obtained from New England Biolabs or GIBCO BRL and used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Reagents for PCR were purchased from Exonuclease assays. Uniformly labeled H-P22 DNA (6) digested with RsaI was used to detect exonuclease activity. Reaction mixtures contained 1 nmol of substrate, 5 l of each fraction, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in a 50- l reaction volume and were incubated at 30 C for 1 h. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 100 l of "stop" solution (20 mM EDTA, 25 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 30 g of sonicated salmon sperm DNA per ml). Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) was added to a final concentration of 5%, and the mixtures were held on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation, aliquots (0.2 ml) were removed, and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme required to digest 1 nmol of H-P22/RsaI DNA in 30 min at 30 C. 3 -end-labeled DNA

was prepared with [ -32P]dATP and Klenow DNA polymerase by using pUC18 DNA cut with EcoRI. 5 -end-labeled DNA was prepared with [ -32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase by using dephosphorylated linear pUC18. Reactions with end-labeled substrates were carried out in a final volume of 50 l. For each reaction, 0.1 pmol (ends) of substrate was incubated with 5 l of each fraction (or the amount indicated in Fig. 3) for 15 min at 30 C and then treated as described above. The overlap recombination assay with substrates pLS89 digested with SalI and M13BS digested with BamHI and crude whole-cell extracts was performed as described previously (20). Reaction products were separated by electrophoresis through 0.8% agarose, followed by staining with ethidium bromide. For reactions with crude extracts, the reaction products were detected by Southern hybridization. The amount of product present on hybridized filters was quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Purification of Exo I. S. cerevisiae LSY346-5A was grown at 30 C with vigorous shaking in YEPD medium. Cells were collected at mid-log phase, resuspended in water (20 ml of water/liter of culture volume), and irradiated with 50 kilorads from a Gammacell-220 irradiator containing Co (Atomic Energy of Canada).

Cells were then transferred to fresh YEPD medium (equivalent to the original volume) and grown for an additional 90 min at 30 C. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with water, and then resuspended in a volume of cell breakage buffer (50 mM HEPES [N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N -2-ethanesulfonic acid; pH 7.6], 5 mM EDTA, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol [vol/vol], 5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 g of pepstatin per ml, 0.5 g of leupeptin per ml) equivalent in milliliters to the wet weight of the cells. The resuspended cells were quickly frozen and stored at 80 C until use. All of the purification steps were performed at 4 C, and protease inhibitors were added to all of the buffers at the same concentration as in the breakage buffer immediately prior to use. One hundred grams of cells was thawed in a mixture of ice and water and broken by eight 45-s pulses with a Beadbeater (Biospec Products). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm in a Sorvall GSA rotor for 45 min. Nucleic acids were removed from the resulting supernatant by precipitation with polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG) to a final concentration of 8%. The PEG precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm in a Sorvall GSA rotor for 30 min, and the clear supernatant was carefully removed (fraction I). Fraction I was immediately applied to a column of ceramic hydroxylapatite (Bio-Rad Laboratories CHT type I; 5 cm2 by 6 cm) that had been equilibrated with 10 mM potassium phosphate (KPO4 [pH 7.2])­10% glycerol­1 mM DTT plus protease inhibitors. The column was developed with a 300-ml linear gradient of 10 mM KPO4 at pH 7.2 to 400 mM KPO4 at pH 6.8 (including glycerol, DTT, and protease inhibitors at the same concentrations as those used above), and fractions were assayed with [3H]P22 substrate DNA. Approximately 30% of the nuclease activity present in fraction I did not bind to the column. Two minor peaks and one major peak of activity were eluted. The major peak that eluted at 210 to 260 mM KPO4 (fraction II) was dialyzed against buffer H (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.6], 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and protease inhibitors) containing 50 mM NaCl. After dialysis, fraction II was applied to a 1-ml SPSepharose column (Pharmacia LKB; Hitrap columns) that had been equilibrated with buffer H containing 50 mM NaCl. The column was developed with a 20-ml linear gradient of 50 to 500 mM NaCl, and 0.4-ml fractions were collected. One major peak of activity was recovered that eluted at 280 to 350 mM NaCl (fraction III). Fraction III was diluted with water to a conductivity equivalent to that of buffer H plus 40 mM NaCl and immediately applied to a 1-ml column of Q-Sepharose (Pharmacia LKB; Hitrap columns) equilibrated with buffer H plus 40 mM NaCl. Most of the activity present in fraction III failed to bind to Q-Sepharose (fraction IV), and this was applied directly to a 1-ml column of heparin agarose (Pharmacia LKB; Hitrap columns) equilibrated with buffer H plus 40 mM NaCl. The heparin agarose column was developed with a 15-ml linear gradient of 40 to 800 mM NaCl, and 0.4-ml fractions were collected. A

single peak of activity eluted at 460 to 525 mM NaCl (fraction V). Fraction V (0.25 ml) was applied to a 24-ml Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Pharmacia LKB) equilibrated with buffer H plus 300 mM NaCl. Activity was recovered in fractions 30 and 31, corresponding to the fractions in which ovalbumin eluted. For analysis of mutant extracts, 4 liters of each culture was grown to mid-log phase in YEPD medium and irradiated as described above. Cells were broken by four 50-s pulses in the small chamber of a Beadbeater and then processed as described above. One hundred milligrams of fraction I from each extract was applied to a 5-ml hydroxylapatite cartridge (Bio-Rad; CHT) and developed with a 50-ml gradient of 10 mM KPO4 at pH 7.2 to 400 mM KPO4 at pH 6.8 (including glycerol, DTT, and protease inhibitors at the same concentrations described above). Determination of mitotic recombination rates. Cells containing the recombination reporter recombine to adenine prototrophy with the concomitant loss of the URA3 gene and plasmid sequences. Thus, cultures to be used for measurement of recombination rates were grown in medium lacking uracil to select for maintenance of the recombination reporter. Cells were grown to an approximate density of 107 cells per ml and washed with water, and dilutions were plated on rich medium and on medium lacking adenine to determine the recombination frequency. Since division of Ade recombinants does not occur in the medium lacking uracil, the frequency of Ade cells is a measure of the recombination rate. The median value was derived from seven independent cultures of each strain. This was repeated two more times, and the average rate from the three trials is given in Table 4. RESULTS Purification of Exo I. We previously identified and partially purified a 5 -3 exonuclease required for recombination of two linear DNA molecules with terminal overlapping homology (20). A typical purification of this activity, now called S. cerevisiae Exo I, is summarized in Table 2. The purification began with the supernatant obtained after PEG precipitation of DNA from a crude whole-cell extract. The PEG precipitation step removed contaminating DNA from the extract that would otherwise interfere with quantitation of exonuclease activity and removed about 50% of the total cellular protein. Approximately 30% of the nuclease activity present in fraction I failed to bind to hydroxylapatite, and two small peaks of nuclease activity eluted before the major peak of Exo I. Although a single peak of nuclease activity was resolved by fractionation of fraction II on SP-Sepharose, this fraction appeared to contain four nuclease activities (data not shown). The major activity did not bind to Q-Sepharose under the conditions employed; it was subsequently purified by heparin agarose and gel filtration chromatography. Two polypeptides with sizes of 44 and 42 kDa coeluted with the single peak of activity recovered by heparin agarose chromatography. In subsequent fractionation by gel filtration chromatography, a single peak of nuclease activity eluted at the same elution volume as ovalbumin (Fig. 1A). Analysis of the protein profile by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel electrophoresis indicated that the 42-kDa polypeptide coeluted with the nuclease activity (Fig. 1B, fractions 30 and 31). The elution profile obtained by gel filtration chromatography indicates that the exonuclease is about 45 kDa in size and is monomeric. Cells treated with ionizing radiation were used for the preparation described in Table 2. The specific activity of Exo I (fraction II) from untreated cells was 2.5-fold less (data not shown). The exonuclease had been purified more than 300-fold

through the heparin agarose step. This is likely to be an underestimate, because there are several nuclease activities present in fraction I and additional weak activities that are removed by chromatography on Q-Sepharose. Because the protein concentration was too low for accurate measurement, we were unable to estimate the purification obtained from the Superdex 75 step. Based on the amount of protein present in fraction V and a 9% yield, we estimate that there are 2,500 molecules of Exo I per induced cell. To ensure that the recombination activity of the purified exonuclease was similar to the activity identified in crude nuclear extracts (20), the overlap recombination assay was performed with pLS89 and M13BS substrates with fraction V. Incubation of the substrates with fraction V resulted in the formation of two products (Fig. 2). The 11.5-kb product (P1) corresponds in size to the expected overlap recombination

product. The high-molecular-weight product (P2) has been observed previously with crude extracts and has a branched structure, as determined by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis (20, 51). The kinetics of product formation observed with the purified exonuclease were similar to those observed with crude nuclear extracts. Exo I is a nonprocessive 5 -3 double-stranded exonuclease. The degree of processivity was determined by challenging Exo I with a threefold molar excess of unlabeled P22 during the course of the reaction with H-labeled P22 DNA (Fig. 3A).

The addition of excess unlabeled DNA resulted in the immediate cessation of activity on the labeled substrate, indicating that Exo I is nonprocessive. The polarity of degradation was determined by incubation of subsaturating concentrations of fraction V (for ends) with either 3 - or 5 -end-labeled substrates. Removal of 60% of the terminal nucleotide from the 5 -end-labeled substrate occurred within 40 min of incubation, whereas little loss of label occurred from the 3 -end-labeled substrate, even after a 40-min incubation (Fig. 3B). To compare the activities of Exo I on single- and double-stranded DNA, reactions were carried out with native or heat-denatured H-labeled P22 DNA. As shown in Fig. 3C, the activity of Exo I was about two times greater on double-stranded DNA than

on single-stranded DNA, and the reaction on both substrates was linear for at least 1 h. Cofactor requirements. The activity of the exonuclease was determined under a variety of reaction conditions (Table 3). The pH optimum was found to be maximal between pH 7.5 and 8, but considerable activity (greater than 50%) was detected at pH 6 and 9 (data not shown). A divalent cation was essential for activity. Mg2 at 5 to 10 mM provided optimal activity, but considerable activity was observed in the presence of 5 mM Mn2 (84%). The addition of Ca2 or Zn2 to the standard reaction mixture was inhibitory. The activity was not stimulated by the addition of ATP, bovine serum albumin (data not shown), or DTT. The activity was unaffected by the addition of 50 mM NaCl, and 50% activity was still detected in the presence of 150 mM NaCl. The substitution of Tris-OAc and Mg(OAc)2 for Tris-HCl and MgCl2 in the standard reaction mixture had no stimulatory effect. The 5 -3 exonuclease is absent from exo1 mutants. The characteristics of the exonuclease described here, such as low processivity, 5 -3 specificity, and cofactor requirements, are quite similar to those described for S. pombe Exo I. The S. cerevisiae homolog of S. pombe Exo I was recently identified in a screening for proteins that interact with the mismatch binding protein Msh2 (57). The S. cerevisiae EXO1 gene encodes an 80-kDa protein, and the overproduced and purified EXO1 gene product has enzymatic properties similar to those of the exonuclease reported here (3a). Exo I is a member of a large family of endo- and exonucleases that have homology to the 5 -3 exonuclease domain of E. coli DNA polymerase I, T4 RNase H, T5 exonuclease D15, T7 gene 6 exonuclease, and E. coli RecJ (33, 38, 53). In S. cerevisiae, there are four other members of this family of nucleases, Rad2, Rad27, Din7, and Yen1. To test whether the exonuclease described here is the product of the S. cerevisiae RAD2, RAD27, DIN7, EXO1, or YEN1 genes, extracts were prepared from isogenic strains containing deletion alleles of these genes. Extracts were prepared from induced cells by PEG precipitation, followed by hydroxylapatite chromatography of fraction I. From the wild-type extract, three peaks of nuclease activity were resolved. The largest peak, which eluted at 200 to 260 mM potassium phosphate, corresponds to the 42-kDa 5 -3 exonuclease described in this report. This peak of activity was undiminished in fractionated extracts from the rad2, rad27, din7, and yen1 strains, but it was completely absent from the exo1 strain (Fig. 4). This result, together with the biochemical characterization, is strong evidence that the 5 -3 exonuclease is the product of the S. cerevisiae EXO1 gene. Because the polypeptide we have purified is substantially smaller than that predicted from the EXO1

ORF, it is likely to correspond to a proteolytic degradation product. We originally identified Exo I through its activity in the overlap recombination assay. Fractionation of wild-type extracts revealed that Exo I was the major activity responsible for this in vitro reaction (20a). To determine whether exo1 mutant extracts were defective in this assay, we compared the activities of EXO1 and exo1 extracts prepared from isogenic strains by using the overlap recombination substrates (Fig. 5). The overlap recombination product was clearly observed with the EXO1 extract, even at low protein concentrations. However, the amount of product was greatly reduced when the exo1 strain was used as a source of extract, consistent with the view that Exo I is the major activity that catalyzes overlap recombination in this in vitro system. As described previously, a product due to end joining was observed when pLS89 was incubated alone in the extract. EXO1 is involved in spontaneous mitotic recombination between direct repeats. The role of Exo I in mitotic recombination in vivo was determined by measuring the rate of recombination between nontandem direct repeats of the ade2 gene (Fig. 6). The two ade2 alleles are truncated at their 3 and 5 ends, respectively, and are separated by plasmid vector sequences including the URA3 gene. Strains containing this duplication form red colonies on agar plates. Recombination events that excise the DNA between the repeats and restore a wild-type copy of the ADE2 gene are visualized as white sectors within the red colony. The rate of recombination is determined from the frequency of Ade prototrophs within a population of cells. Strains containing this direct repeat and a disruption of

Lanes 1 to 4 are pLS89 and M13BS incubated with crude whole-cell extract prepared from an EXO1 strain, and lanes 5 to 8 are incubated with the exo1 extract. Lanes 9 and 10 are pLS89 and M13BS incubated separately with the EXO1 extract. Protein concentrations (in milligrams per milliliter) are as follows: lane 1, 0.42; lane 2, 0.84; lane 3, 1.68; lane 4, 2.52; lane 5, 0.43; lane 6, 0.86; lane 7, 1.72; lane 8, 2.58; lane 9, 2.52; and lane 10, 2.52.

Reaction products were separated on a 0.8% agarose gel which was then Southern blotted. The probe used hybridizes to the pLS89 substrate and the overlap product. Some nonspecific hybridization to M13BS is also observed.

the EXO1 gene were found to have reduced sectoring (Fig. 6) and showed a sixfold lower rate of recombination than wildtype cells (Table 4). Recombination between direct repeats is reduced synergistically by mutation of the RAD1 and RAD52 genes (27, 43, 56). Since the mismatch repair genes MSH2 and MSH3 have been shown to act in the Rad1 pathway for direct repeat recombination (42), it was of interest to determine the effect of an exo1 mutation on recombination in either a rad1 or rad52 background. Mutation of RAD1 or RAD52 was shown to reduce recombination 9- or 14-fold, respectively (Table 4). As has been demonstrated previously, the rad1 and rad52 double mutant showed a synergistic reduction in the frequency of recombination. However, the exo1 mutation had no effect in either the rad1 or rad52 background, and the exo1 rad1 rad52 triple mutant showed the same frequency of recombination as the rad1 rad52 double mutant. To determine whether Exo1 is involved in the repair of DSBs in vivo, exo1 strains were also tested for gamma-ray sensitivity, mating-type switching, and sporulation. exo1 mutants showed wild-type resistance to ionizing radiation and were proficient at mating-type switching (data not shown). Homozygous exo1 diploids showed reduced sporulation (44% unsporulated cells compared with 14% for an isogenic wildtype diploid), and spore viability was slightly reduced (78% for exo1 strains compared with 98% for the wild-type diploid). DISCUSSION We previously described a 5 -3 exonuclease that catalyzed recombination between two linear DNA molecules with terminal overlapping homology (20). The exonuclease exposed 3 single-stranded complementary tails that could be annealed to form a joint molecule. Here, we describe the purification of this exonuclease and provide evidence that it is the product of the EXO1 gene.

FIG. 6. Mitotic recombination between direct repeats is reduced in exo1 mutants. (A) The substrate consists of two nontandem direct repeats of truncated alleles of the ade2 gene separated by vector sequences, including the URA3 gene. Recombination to restore the ADE2 gene results in loss of the intervening sequences. (B) Recombination events are visualized as white sectors and papillae within a red colony.

The exonuclease has been purified more than 300-fold from mitotic cells treated with ionizing radiation. The increased activity observed by treatment of cells with ionizing radiation could be due to damage inducibility and/or cell cycle-regulated expression. There is an MluI site, or MluI cell cycle box (MCB) (36), located 253 nucleotides upstream of the ATG which could be involved in cell cycle-regulated transcription of the EXO1 gene. Transcription of the RAD27 gene has been shown to be both cell cycle regulated and inducible by methyl methanesulfonate (61). RAD2 transcript levels are also elevated after exposure of cells to DNA-damaging agents (46). The exonuclease activity was shown to copurify with a 42kDa polypeptide and appears to be monomeric in solution. The biochemical properties, such as polarity, nonprocessivity, and cofactor requirements, are quite similar to those described for S. pombe Exo I (52) and for the purified, overproduced S. cerevisiae EXO1 gene product (3a). However, the S. pombe and S. cerevisiae activities do differ in their ability to degrade single-

stranded DNA. Exo I of S. pombe is quite specific for doublestranded DNA, whereas the exonuclease described here shows only a twofold preference for double-stranded over singlestranded DNA substrates. Because of the similarity between the two exonucleases, it seemed quite likely that the exonuclease described here is the homolog of S. pombe Exo I or one of the other members of the Rad2 family. The Rad2 family of proteins have significant homology over two regions designated the N and I boxes. These two regions have motifs that are also conserved in prokaryotic DNA polymerase I, T4 RNase H, T5 exonuclease D15, T7 gene 6 exonuclease, and E. coli RecJ (33, 38). Within these regions are several highly conserved acidic residues that constitute the active site of T4 RNase H. In S. cerevisiae, there are five members of this family: Rad2, Rad27, Exo1/Dhs1, Din7, and Yen1. Rad2 and Rad27 have demonstrated endonuclease and exonuclease activities (14, 15, 17), whereas Din7 and Yen1 are predicted to be members of this family based on sequence homology. The predicted Din7 protein is highly homologous to Exo1 (56% identity and 75% similarity over the N-terminal 367 amino acids). Although Yen1 is the least-conserved member of this family, it does contain most of the acidic residues that form the T4 RNase H active site. When fractionated by PEG precipitation and hydroxylapatite chromatography, the exo1 extracts were found to lack the major peak of exonuclease activity corresponding to the 42kDa exonuclease described here, whereas fractionated extracts from rad2, rad27, din7, and yen1 strains retained this activity (Fig. 4). Extracts prepared from exo1 mutant strains were deficient in the overlap recombination assay, consistent with Exo I being the major nuclease that promotes this in vitro reaction (Fig. 5). The residual activity observed in the exo1 extracts could be due to one or more of the other nucleases or putative nucleases described above. The purified exonuclease was shown to promote joint molecule formation in the overlap recombination assay with kinetics similar to those observed with crude nuclear extracts. Together, these results provide strong evidence that the 42-kDa exonuclease is the product of the EXO1 gene. The predicted Exo1 protein is much larger than the 42-kDa protein described above. The N and I box regions which contain the nuclease domain are found within the N-terminal half of the protein. This region of the protein is predicted to be contained within a 33-kDa polypeptide. Thus, it seems plausible that proteolysis of Exo1 could generate a polypeptide with a size of 42 kDa that retains nuclease activity. Since S. pombe Exo I was also purified as a proteolytic degradation product (52, 53), it seems quite possible that this part of both proteins is particularly susceptible to proteolysis. The S. cerevisiae EXO1 gene was identified in a screening for proteins that interact with the MutS homolog, Msh2 (57). Mutation of EXO1 in S. cerevisiae, or of exo1 in S. pombe, results in a weak mutator phenotype consistent with a role in mismatch repair (53, 57). Although exo1 mutants of S. pombe and S. cerevisiae show no apparent defect in meiotic recombination (53), the S. cerevisiae exo1 strain is deficient in mitotic recombination between direct repeats. The assay used in this study measures deletion formation between truncated repeats of the ADE2 gene. This type of recombination assay was used because it most closely resembles the in vitro assay originally used to identify Exo I. Deletions are thought to arise by a variety of mechanisms, including intrachromatid crossing over, single-strand annealing, sister strand mispairing, replication slippage, one-ended invasion, sister chromatid exchange, and sister chromatid conversion (28, 39). Because there are many alternate pathways for deletion formation, mutation of any one

gene rarely results in a strong reduction in the rate of recombination between directly repeated sequences. The reduction observed in the exo1 strain is of a magnitude similar to that observed with mutation of the RAD1, RAD10, or RAD52 genes (Table 4) (27, 43, 44, 56). It has recently been demonstrated that mutation of MSH2 or MSH3 results in reduced rates of recombination between repeated sequences (42). However, pms1 and mlh1 mutants do not show a reduction in the rate of direct repeat recombination, suggesting that mitotic recombination deficiency is not a general phenotype of mismatch repair mutants (42). The effect of the exo1 mutation on direct repeat recombination is very similar to that observed with msh2 and msh3 mutations. Epistasis analysis has shown that Msh2 and Msh3 act in the Rad1 pathway of direct repeat recombination. As shown in Table 4, no synergism was observed for the exo1 rad52 double mutant, indicating that its effect is distinct from that of msh2 or msh3. One interpretation of this observation is that Exo1 acts early in the recombination reaction to produce a substrate that can be utilized in either of the Rad1 or Rad52 pathways. Exonucleases are predicted to be involved in early steps of recombination to generate regions of single-stranded DNA that are the substrate for binding by homologous pairing proteins. In this capacity, 5 -3 exonucleases could act at double-strand ends to produce 3 single-stranded tails or could act to enlarge a nick to a single-stranded gap. We suggest that there is redundancy for this step to explain the weak phenotype in recombination and radiation resistance of the exo1 mutant. In this respect, the phenotypes of exo1 strains may be compared with those of E. coli recJ mutants. RecJ is a component of the methyl-directed mismatch repair pathway, yet recJ mutants show a very modest mutator phenotype due to functional redundancy for the exonuclease processing step. Furthermore, recJ mutants show recombination deficiency and UV sensitivity only in the absence of RecBCD (34). An exonuclease could also act at later steps in the recombination reaction by processing recombination intermediates. Since the ade2 alleles employed in this study are truncation alleles, we would not expect to generate heteroduplex intermediates containing mismatches that would then be subject to repair by the mismatch repair system. Thus, it is unlikely that the defect in direct repeat recombination observed in exo1 mutants results from failure to repair heteroduplex DNA. It is also unlikely that the reduction in the rate of Ade prototroph formation is due to the accumulation of mutations within the ade2 repeats, because the rate of recombination is several orders of magnitude greater than the rate of spontaneous mutation in exo1 strains. In summary, we have purified and characterized a 5 -3 exonuclease from S. cerevisiae which has biochemical properties very similar to those of S. pombe Exo I. This activity is absent from extracts prepared from an S. cerevisiae exo1 mutant strain, indicating that it is the homolog of S. pombe Exo I. We have shown that extracts prepared from the exo1 mutant are defective in the in vitro recombination assay that was originally used to identify the exonuclease. Finally, the exo1 mutant strain was also shown to have a reduced rate of recombination between direct repeats, suggesting a role in recombination in vivo.
