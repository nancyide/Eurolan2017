Abstract

The Rvs161p and Rvs167p proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, homologues of higher eukaryotes' amphiphysins, associate with actin and appear to be involved in several functions related to the actin cytoskeleton. In order to identify partners of the Rvsp proteins, yeast libraries constructed in two-hybrid vectors were screened using either Rvs167p or Rvs161p as a bait. The selected candidates, representing 34 ORFs, were then tested against both Rvsp proteins, as well as domains of Rvs167p or Rvs161p. Among the most signi®cant ones, 24 ORFs were speci®c preys of Rvs167p only and two gave interactions with Rvs161p only. Interestingly, ®ve ORFs were preys of both Rvs161p and Rvs167p (RVS167, LAS17, YNL094w, YMR192w and YPL249c). Analysis of putative functions of the candidates con®rm involvement of the Rvsp in endocytosis/vesicle traf®c, but also opens possible new ®elds, such as nuclear functions.

Introduction If the ®rst metabolic studies in yeast have been based on the concept that proteins were freely diffusing in the cellular matrix, numerous biological functions are today proved to work as strongly organized multicomponent structures. The description of such complexes in terms of composition, architecture and integrated functions has been recently opened in yeast by the availability of the proteome databank. In fact, both biochemical (puri®cation) and genetical (two-hybrid) approaches are based on the possibility of quickly identifying partners through very limited information on each of them. In the biochemical approach (Rigaut et al., 1999), trypsin digest pro®les are {E. Bon and P. Recordon-Navarro contributed equally to this work.

suf®cient to identify the different components. In the genetic approach, a single run of DNA sequence of each clone is enough to obtain the same result (Fromont-Racine et al., 1997). We present here the results of two-hybrid screens based on two proteins, Rvs161p and Rvs167p (reduced viability upon starvation), which form a structural and functional heterodimer (Navarro et al., 1997). Considering these two proteins as a `core' of a larger complex, we expected to ®nd protein partners with signi®cant relations (structural and/or functional) with one or both the Rvs proteins, and also between them. Rvs161p and Rvs167p of baker's yeast (Crouzet et al., 1991; Bauer et al., 1993), their homologues in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, as well as mammalian amphiphysins and a nematode isoform constitute a family of conserved proteins (David et al., 1994; Sakamuro et al., 1996; Wigge & McMahon, 1998).

Indeed, all proteins but Rvs161p share the same overall structure, divided into three domains (Figure 1): a conserved N-terminal domain, containing predicted coiled-coil structures and called the Bin1/amphiphysin/Rvs domain (BAR) domain, characteristic of the protein family (Sakamuro et al., 1996); a C-terminal domain consisting of a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain; and a central a glycine-, proline- and alanine-rich (GPA) domain in Rvs167p, which varies among members of the protein family. The entire Rvs161p consists of a BAR domain. Amphiphysin I was ®rst identi®ed in the brain as a protein associated with synaptic vesicles (Lichte et al., 1992). Amphiphysin II, in spite of having a different tissue distribution spectrum, is also found predominantly in the brain (Tsutsui et al., 1997; Wigge et al., 1997; Sakamuro et al., 1996; Sparks et al., 1996; Leprince et al., 1997; Ramjaun et al., 1997; Butler et al., 1997). Both amphiphysins have splice variants, the amphiphysin II variants being named BIN1, SH3P9, BRAMP-2 or ALP1. The largest isoforms of both amphiphysins are brainspeci®c, form a stable heterodimer (Wigge et al., 1997) and are involved in synaptic vesicle recycling by endocytosis (David et al., 1996; De Camilli & Takei, 1996). During this process, amphiphysins interact with a number of proteins, such as AP-2 adaptor complexes, unpolymerized clathrin, GTPase dynamin and synaptojanin. Outside the brain, splice variants of amphiphysin II have been found: (a) in skeletal muscle as a 50 kD protein, where it forms homodimers localized along T tubules together with ankyrin 3 and clathrin (Butler et al., 1997); (b) in some cell lines, the BIN1 isoform is localized in the nucleus and has a tumour suppression effect due, in part at least, to its interaction with Myc (Sakamuro et al., 1996; Wechsler-Reya et al., 1998); (c) in a broad range of tissues, the ALP1 isoform interacts with the c-Abl tyrosine kinase, mediating the cytoskeletal role of c-Abl (Kadlec & Pendergast, 1997). Thus, the physiological functions of amphiphysins appear to be the consequences of numerous protein± protein contacts in accordance with their putative structure. Yeast Rvs161p and Rvs167p likely are embedded in a protein complex, as suggested by their numerous interactions. (a) Two-hybrid test (Chien et al., 1991) and co-immunoprecipitation show that Rvs161p and Rvs167p assemble in a heterodimer Copyright # 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. (Navarro et al., 1997). This result gives a molecular basis to the fact that the deletion of RVS161 or RVS167, or the double mutation, leads to a nearly identical spectrum of phenotypes: reduced viability and abnormal cell morphology in poor growth or salted media (Crouzet et al., 1991; Bauer et al., 1993; Lee et al., 1998), delocalized actin cortical patches in impaired growth conditions (Bauer et al., 1993; Sivadon et al., 1995), random budding in diploids (Bauer et al., 1993; Sivadon et al., 1995; Durrens et al., 1995), endocytotic defects (Munn et al., 1995), impaired sporulation in rvs161 (Desfarges et al., 1993; Colwill et al., 1999) and cell fusion defect in rvs161 (Dorer et al., 1997; Brizzio et al., 1998). Furthermore, both mutations are suppressed by the same set of sur mutations (Desfarges et al., 1993). (b) Two-hybrid results and genetic data indicate interactions with myosin (Breton & Aigle, 1998) and actin (Munn et al., 1995; Amberg et al., 1995; Breton & Aigle, 1998), which may be indirect as Rvs167p also binds to the actin-binding protein, Abp1p (Lila & Drubin, 1997). These interactions give clues as to how Rvs161p and Rvs167p are involved in endocytosis (Munn et al., 1995; Singer-KruÈger & Ferro-Novick, 1997) and in the control of the budding pattern of diploid cells (Bauer et al., 1993; Durrens et al., 1995). Rvsp proteins and amphiphysins are all implicated in endocytosis but, in contrast to the mammalian situation, no direct interaction between Rvsp proteins and yeast's dynamin has been reported so far. (c) Rvs167p is a target of Pcl1,2p±Pho85p complexes and binds to Pcl2p and related cyclins (Lee et al., 1998), thereby establishing a connection between cyclin-dependent kinases and the actin cytoskeleton. This link could participate in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in response to non-optimal physiological conditions. (d) Rvs161p interacts with Fus2p and participates in the fusion process during mating. Thus, in spite of its apparent one-domain structure, Rvs161p appears to be a bifunctional protein, the N-part being involved in cytoskeleton-related functions and the C-part being more speci®cally implicated in cell fusion (Brizzio et al., 1998; Gammie et al., 1998). Recently, Rvs161p has been shown to interact with Ybr108wp, a protein similar to Pan1p, which is involved in vesicular traf®cking (Uetz et al., 2000). The role of Rvs167p domains has been analysed (Sivadon et al., 1997; Colwill et al., 1999): the BAR domain is required for all the Rvs167p functions Yeast 2000; 16: 1229±1241.

except for sporulation, the GPA domain contains a site for cyclin Pcl2p binding and helps SH3 domain functions, and the SH3 domain appears directly involved in sporulation. Despite their similarity, the BAR domain of Rvs167p cannot be replaced by Rvs161p (Sivadon et al., 1997). Despite all these data, the precise molecular functions of both Rvsp are not elucidated. However, the domain structure of these proteins and the data cited above suggest that the functions are driven by molecular interactions. To identify the targets or interaction partners of Rvsp, we used the two-hybrid system to screen DNA libraries from yeast with both Rvs161p or Rvs167p as baits. As Rvs161p and Rvs167p were shown to form a complex (Navarro et al., 1997), each prey sequence was then tested against the bait which was not used to select it. Indeed, we obtained speci®c interaction partners of either Rvsp, and partners to both Rvsp. The two-hybrid system was also used to test the selected partners against de®ned domains of both Rvsp.

Materials and methods Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and media The Y187 (Harper et al., 1993) (MATa, ura3-52, his3-200, ade2-101, trp1-901, leu2-3,112, met-, gal4D, gal80D, URA3::GAL1uas-GAL1tata-LacZ) and the HF7c (Feilotter et al., 1994) (MATa, ura3-52, his3-200, ade2-101, trp1-901, leu2-3,112, lys2-801, gal4-542, gal80-530, LYS2::GAL1uasGAL1tata-HIS3) strains were used for the screening of the genomic DNA library. The L40 strain (Vojtek et al., 1993) (MATa, leu2-3,112, trp1-901, his3D200, ade2, LYS2::(lexAop)4-HIS3, URA3:: (lexAop)8-LacZ.GAL4) was used for the screening of the cDNA library. YPD complete medium (Sherman, 1991), solidi®ed with 20 g agar when required, was used for cell growth. SD minimal synthetic medium , containing 6.7 g/l of Yeast Nitrogen Base (Difco) without amino acids, 20 g of glucose as carbon source, and a mix of 10 amino acids (Sherman, 1991), to which tryptophan (200 mg/l), leucine (1 g/l), histidine (200 mg/l), and 3-amino-1.2.4-triazole (3AT) (3 or 5 mM) were added when required, was used as selective medium.

Two-hybrid libraries The yeast genomic DNA library `FRYL' (FromontRacine et al., 1997) was kindly provided by M. Fromont-Racine and P. Legrain (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). This library contains 5r106 different Escherichia coli clones with genomic DNA fragments of about 700 bp cloned into the pACTII multicopy vector which carries the yeast LEU2 gene and the GAL4 transcription activation domain (AD). The yeast cDNA library, which is also based on the multicopy pACT vector, was a gift from R. Sternglanz (Park & Sternglanz, 1999). Two-hybrid plasmids Centromeric plasmids The bait vector pDBT (Navarro et al., 1997), which carries the yeast TRP1 gene and the GAL4 DNA binding domain (DB) was fused to the complete coding sequences of RVS161 or RVS167, or to different sequence fragments encoding regions of both Rvsp. Four regions were de®ned in the Rvs167p (Figure 1). The sequences coding for the BAR (amino acids 1±296), GPA (amino acids 284±434), SH3 (amino acids 426±482) and GPA+SH3 (amino acids 284±482) regions of the Rvs167p were obtained by PCR ampli®cation from the pDBT±RVS167 plasmid. The speci®c oligonucleotides used (Table 1), also contained BglII or NotI restriction sites, allowing in-frame cloning into pDBT vector as BglII±NotI fragments. Two regions (Figure 2) were de®ned in Rvs161p, based on the results of Brizzio et al. (1998): a Nterminal region (amino acids 1±166) termed ACE, proposed to be involved in actin cytoskeleton organization and endocytosis, and a C-terminal region (amino acids 151±264) termed CF, proposed to be involved in cellular fusion. The sequences coding for these regions were ampli®ed by PCR from pDBT-RVS161 plasmid using speci®c oligonucleotides (Table 1). Likewise, these fragments were cloned in-frame into pDBT vector as BglII± NotI fragments. Multicopy plasmids The pBTM116±RVS167 multicopy plasmid used as bait for the cDNA library screening was obtained as follows. A DNA segment containing the whole RVS167 ORF was ampli®ed by PCR using Yeast 2000; 16: 1229±1241.

The resulting fragment was cut with EcoRI and PstI and then inserted into the EcoRI±PstI gap of the pBTM116 vector. Two-hybrid experiment Mating strategy was performed as described by Bendixen et al. (1994). Y187 (MATa) and HF7c (MATa) cells were transformed, respectively, by prey and bait plasmids, according to the Li-acetate TRAFO method (Gietz et al., 1997) . In this assay, a 250 ml Erlenmeyer ¯ask containing 2r107 cells of each mating partner, mixed together in 2 ml liquid YPD medium, and placed on an orbital incubator (100 tr/min) for 3 h at 30uC. Cells were then pelleted for 5 min at 5000 rpm, gently resuspended in 2 ml liquid YPD medium, and agitated once again as previously for 2 h. Diploid cells containing both plasmids were then plated on selective medium and allowed to grow at 30uC. Two-hybrid screening was also conducted using a haploid strain, L40, possessing the bait plasmid (pBTM116-RVS167). L40[pBTM116-RVS167] strain was grown to exponential phase (ca.2r107 cells/ml) in 150 ml YPD at 25uC. Cells were Copyright # 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

collected by spinning down for 1 min at 3000 rpm and treated with Li-acetate (1.8 ml), as described above. Competent cells were distributed into six small tubes, each of which was subjected to transformation experiment with the cDNA library. In both types of cells, the HIS3 reporter system was assayed in drop tests, by testing the ability of cells (#2r105) to grow on SD medium without leucine, tryptophane and histidine, but with the addition of 3 mM 3AT for diploid cells, or 5 mM for 5 days followed by colony isolation on 30 mM of 3AT for haploid L40 cells. Sequencing The library plasmids were rescued from yeast cells and transferred into bacteria according to Robzyk & Kassir (1992). The DNA genomic inserts and the different constructions were sequenced using a T7 Sequencing Kit (Pharmacia Biotech). Results Screening of libraries Screening with Rvs167p from a centromeric vector The Y187 yeast strain was transformed with the genomic DNA library, and the HF7c strain by the pDBT±RVS167 plasmid.

Figure 2. Sub-domains of the yeast Rvs161p protein. Predicted coiled-coil structure of Rvs161p was obtained in silico using the Paircoil algorithm (Berger et al., 1995). Both the ACE (actin cytoskeleton/endocytosis) domain and the CF (cellular fusion) domain of the Rvs161p were de®ned based on experiments by Brizzio et al. (1998). Flanking regions of 15 amino acids (&) were added on both sides of amino acid 166, de®ning an ACE region (amino acids 1±181) at the N-terminal and a CF region (amino acids 151±265) at the C-terminal of the Rvs161p protein

Both transformed strains were then mated (2r107 cells of each strain) and the diploids positively selected on SD medium without leucine, tryptophan or histidine, but enriched with 3 mM of 3AT. After a 3 day incubation, 112 clones were obtained out of 8r106 plated diploids. These clones were streaked on fresh SD medium containing 3 mM 3AT. Only six clones out of the 112 diploids failed to survive. Plasmids were rescued from the remaining diploids, transformed into E. coli and extracted for restriction analysis.

mids in the yeast diploids, whereas the library plasmids were multicopy. Thus 88 library plasmids were rescued. The insert of each library plasmid was sequenced starting from inside the GAL4 AD domain, in order to encompass the junction, and hence the linker (which we found to be of variable length), between the GAL4 AD sequence and the insert. The obtained sequences were then compared to the full yeast genome at SGD (Saccharomyces Genome Database, http://genome-www.stanford.

yeast DNA insert, among which 45 corresponded to in-phase ORF fragments, the remainder contained either an out-of-phase ORF fragment (12 inserts) or non-coding regions (18 inserts). Due to the number of open reading frames (ORFs) we had to deal with, we decided to focus on in-phase ORFs only. Some inserts were found identically several times and only one of each sort was kept for the subsequent tests. Finally, these 45 inserts were reduced to 26 and found to belong to 19 different ORFs (for a list, see Table 2).

Screening with Rvs167p from a multicopy vector The pBTM116±RVS167 plasmid was ®rst introduced into L40 by selecting transformants growing on SD medium without tryptophan. Then, a yeast cDNA library constructed in the pACT vector, which contains the Gal4p activation domain (AD) and LEU2 as a marker, was introduced into the L40 (pBTM116±RVS167) strain and the transformation mixtures were spread on SD medium without leucine, tryptophan or histidine and with 5 mM 3AT. After 5 days incubation, colonies were isolated by screening approximately 100 000 transformants and subjected to single colony isolation on SD±leucine±tryptophan±histidine medium with 30 mM 3AT. 62 hybrid interactants were obtained among 104 expected transformants, each containing bait and library plasmid. Plasmid DNA derived from the candidates was extracted and reintroduced into L40 (pBTM116±RVS167) strain to con®rm the reproductibility of two-hybrid interaction. Then, the DNA sequence of the cDNA portion of each Copyright # 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

isolate was determined and 30 different ORFs were found. Screening with Rvs161p from a centromeric vector We used the same procedure as in `Screening with Rvs167p from a centromeric vector', above, to select Rvs161p interactants. After 3 days incubation, we collected 119 clones from the 4r106 diploids plated on selective medium, and streaked them on fresh medium. Of these clones, 18 did not survive and 80 plasmids were recued from the remaining clones. The inserts of these plasmids were characterized by sequencing and 59 contained a yeast DNA insert; 29 inserts were in-phase ORF fragments, 18 were out-of-phase ORF fragments and 12 corresponded to non-coding regions. The inphase inserts were reduced to 13 by elimination of doublets and came from nine different ORFs (Table 2). Tests against both Rvsp proteins For each screening, each library plasmid which contained an in-phase ORF fragment as insert was transformed into Y187 cells. Each clone was then mated with three different HF7c strains: (a) cells containing the pDBT vector without insert, to verify the speci®city of the interaction; (b) cells containing a plasmid encoding the Rvsp fusion protein which was used during the screening of the considered library plasmid, to con®rm that the growth on selective medium is dependent on the library plasmid; (c) cells which expressed the Rvsp fusion protein which was not used as bait during Yeast 2000; 16: 1229±1241.

selection, to identify which candidate interacted with both Rvsps. The diploids were selected on SD medium without leucine or tryptophan. They were then dropped on SD medium without leucine nor tryptophan as growth control, or on SD medium without leucine, tryptophan, histidine, but with 3 mM 3AT, as a protein±protein interaction test. At this point, it should be noted that here the bait plasmids were centromeric (i.e. pDBT, pDBTRVS161, pDBT-RVS167). As a consequence, only 14 out of the 30 library plasmids selected with Rvs167p from a multicopy plasmid led to a growth on selective medium in cells producing Rvs167p from a single-copy plasmid (see Discussion). In order to preserve homogeneity, we considered only those clones for further studies. Also, in one case involving a plasmid selected with Rvs167p from a single-copy bait plasmid, the tests were all negative and thus the plasmid was discarded as a screening false positive. Altogether, 52 inserts, coming from the three screenings, were reduced to 50 by elimination of surprisingly rare overlaps between screens. These inserts, representing 34 ORFs, remained under scrutiny (Table 2). Among these candidates, four (corresponding to four different ORFs) were positive even with the DB domain alone, and therefore were not speci®c. Only three candidates (representing two ORFs) were Rvs161p-speci®c interactants, whereas 29 candidates (24 ORFs) induced reporter genes when co-expressed with Rvs167p. Finally, 14 candidates (®ve ORFs) gave positive results with both Rvs161p and Rvs167p. Interestingly, the four shorter inserts corresponding to YNL094c were positive against Rvs167p alone, whereas the longest two were positive against both baits. Test of the candidates against domains of Rvsp Test of the candidates against Rvs167p domains The Y187 strain was transformed with the 43 plasmids containing in-phase inserts interacting with pDBT-RVS167 (Table 3), and the HF7c strain with the four pDBT plasmids containing the coding sequences regions for the BAR domain, the GPA domain, the SH3 domain or the GPA+SH3 region of Rvs167p (Figure 1). This last region was tested in case the SH3 domain had to be joined to the GPA domain in order to remain functional, as suggested by Colwill et al. (1999). Both strains were then mated. The diploids were selected, and afterCopyright # 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

wards, the expression of the HIS3 reporter gene was tested as above. Seven fused polypeptides interacted exclusively with the BAR domain, two with both BAR and GPA+SH3 domains, none with the isolated GPA domain, 23 of the candidates interacted with the GPA+SH3 region (among them only eight gave a positive result with the SH3 domain alone), and 11 candidates did not interact with any tested domain. Test of the candidates against Rvs161p domains The Y187 strain was transformed with the 17 plasmids containing in-phase inserts interacting with pDBT-RVS161, and the HF7c strain with the two pDBT plasmids containing the coding sequences of two regions of RVS161, termed ACE (for actin-cytoskeleton-endocytosis domain) and CF (for Control of Fusion domain), these domains were delimited according to the results of Brizzio et al.(1998) (Figure 2). It should be noted that the ACE domain contains the coiled-coil regions predicted by computer analysis (Berger et al., 1995). Both strains were then mated. The diploids were selected, and the expression of the HIS3 reporter gene was tested, as above. None of the isolated domains gave any positive result with the different candidates. Discussion As previously stated, yeast Rvs161p and Rvs167p undergo several known protein interactions: with actin (Munn et al., 1995; Amberg et al., 1995; Breton & Aigle, 1998) and Abp1p (Lila & Drubin, 1997), Rvs167p is also a target of Pcl1,2p±Pho85p complexes and binds to Pcl2p and related cyclins (Lee et al., 1998), and Rvs161p interacts with Fus2p to control cell fusion during mating (Brizzio et al., 1998; Gammie et al., 1998). Two different sets of conditions were used when Rvs167p was a bait: either the bait on a centromeric plasmid against a genomic library, or the bait on a multicopy plasmid against a cDNA library. The groups of candidates obtained from the two screenings were quite different, with a small overlap. This difference can be interpreted in terms of bait quantity and library structure. Alternatively, it can be also interpreted as a consequence of nonexhaustive screens. In the different screenings, for the sake of clarity, Copyright # 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. we chose to consider only those inserts which were in phase with the AD domain of GAL4, to make sure that the considered candidate were genuine yeast ORF products. The out-of-phase candidates might include unnatural translation products, or yeast proteins can alternatively be recovered after a ribosome slippage (Stahl et al., 1995; Sourdive et al., 1997; Fromont-Racine et al., 1997). Some out-ofphase candidates, such as YJR115w and MTH1, were re-phased and induced toxicity, as indicated by their growth rate (data not shown). When the prey candidates were re-tested against both Rvsps from a centromeric plasmid, numerous candidates (16 out of 30) initially selected with a multicopy bait plasmid no longer responded, strengthening the interpretation on the effect of bait quantity, that a high quantity of protein may be necessary for some interactions. The non-interacting candidates in the centromeric experiment (ENO2, MED7, MRPL40, NOP56, POP2, PRP21, RPN6, SHE3, STE50, YBR197c, YDL225w, YDR359c, YKL172w, YNL051w, YNL176c, and YPL077c) were not retained in this study, although they may be biologically signi®cant. None of the false positive inserts we obtained fell into any categories reported in the E. Golemis Web site (http://www.fccc.edu/research/labs/golemis/ main_false.html). The retained candidates interacted with Rvs167p or Rvs161p or both (which was expected, since Rvs161p and Rvs167p form a protein complex). However, it appears also that either Rvsp can interact on its own with several proteins, which leads to the hypothesis that Rvs161p and Rvs167p can exist individually out of their complex. The candidates interacting with Rvs167p appeared to be involved either in cellular traf®cking or cell maintenance: (i) Three candidates appeared to be involved in vesicle transport. The protein Sec21p is a component of the COPI complex required for retrograde Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum transport and recycling of vesicles of secretory system (Gaynor & Emr, 1997); Sec8p and Exo70p proteins are components of the same exocytosis complex involved in Golgi-toplasma membrane vesicle transport and in the late secretory pathway (TerBush et al., 1996). The exocyst complex is localized at small bud tips and the polarized localization to the cell Yeast 2000; 16: 1229±1241.

cortex of Sec8p prior to budding requires actin ®laments (Ayscough et al., 1997), which correlates to the abnormal accumulation of Golgiderived secretory vesicles seen in some actin mutants (Mulholland et al., 1997). Rvs proteins are also involved in the internalization step of endocytosis (Munn et al., 1995). Rvs167p also physically interacted with Kap122p, involved in nuclear-cytoplasmic transport (Pemberton et al., 1998; Kaffman et al., 1998). Finally, two partners appeared to be involved in actin cytoskeleton and cellular fusion: Rvs161p and Las17p (Li, 1997; Brizzio et al., 1998; Colwill et al., 1999). Las17p is involved in actin regulation and endocytosis (Li, 1997; Naqvi et al., 1998), which is in accordance with the rvs mutant phenotypes (Sivadon et al., 1995; Munn et al., 1995; Lee et al., 1998). (ii) A more heterogenous group of protein partners appeared involved in overall cell maintenance. Several polypeptides are involved in structure maintenance, such as Yrf1-1, an Yk-helicase involved in chromatin/chromosome structure (Yamada et al., 1998), and Esp1p, a separin protein required for Mcd1p cleavage, sister chromatid separation and the regulation of spindle body duplication (Schwer & Shuman, 1996); esp1 mutants exhibit heterogeneous morphologies, such as 60±70% unbudded cells, and fail to elongate the spindles, although cytokinesis occurs on schedule (Baum et al.,1988; Surana et al., 1993). Sec21p can also be classi®ed into this category: as a component of the COPI coat, it has a potential role in maintaining protein scaffold integrity of Golgi cisternae (Gaynor et al., 1998). Finally, Sln1p is involved in a signal transduction pathway of extracellular osmolarity variations (Posas & Saito, 1998) and Ecm30p is a protein known to be involved in cell wall structure or biosynthesis (Lussier et al., 1997). Four proteins are involved in RNA processing and DNA repair: Msu1p, a nuclease essential for mitochondrial biogenesis (Dziembowski et al., 1998); Lcp5p, an RNA-binding protein localized at the nucleolus; Tfc6p, the polymerase transcription initiation factor TFIIIC (tau) subunit (Kassavetis et al., 1996; Wiederkehr et al., 1998): and Mus81p, a protein involved in repair of DNA (FromontRacine et al., 1997). Copyright # 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Several partners play various functions in metabolism: in copper homeostasis on the cell surface with Slf1p (Yu et al., 1996), in nucleotide metabolism with Ura7p (Nadkarni et al., 1995) and in protein translocation with Srp54p, a signal recognition protein which binds to nascent polypeptide chains (Brown et al., 1994). (iii) Other putative protein partners of Rvs167p (Ycl036wp, Ydr229wp, Ygl060wp, Yhl002wp, Ynl094wp and Ypl181wp) do not have any reported function. According to the tests with the domains of Rvs167p, the candidates interact either with the BAR domain or the SH3 domain but never with the isolated GPA domain, pointing out that both ends of the Rvs167p protein are involved in protein interaction, and that each domain seems to perform a different function, as was recently shown by Colwill et al. (1999). Some candidates do not interact with any isolated domain, probably because they need the overall structure of Rvs167p to establish an interaction. Concerning the few candidates interacting with Rvs161p, they appeared to be mainly involved in cellular traf®cking, suggesting a specialization of Rvs161p compared to Rvs167p in yeast. This functional aspect could be partly due due to the speci®c structure of Rvs161p in comparison to Rvs167p and the other members of the BAR family (Figure 1). Surprisingly, Fus2p is the most frequent protein partner identi®ed for Rvs161p, since 11 clones containing two distinct Fus2p peptides have been found. The identi®cation of Fus2p as a partner of Rvs161p has already been reported, demonstrating that Rvs161p and Fus2p interact physically and act in concert after vesicle positioning to promote cell fusion during mating (Gammie et al., 1998). It has been proposed that Fus2p, which functions downstream of or in parallel with Rvs161p and Spa2p, may help to orientate and to anchor the cytoplasmic microtubules at a cortical site in the tip of the mating projection (Rose, 1996). Recently, Brizzio et al. (1998) reported that certain rvs161 mutants having strong endocytotic defects did not have cell fusion defects, and conversely, suggesting the existence of two distinct sub-domains in the Rvs161p. Based on these ®ndings, we de®ned these regions in the Rvs161p: a N-terminal region (amino Yeast 2000; 16: 1229±1241.

acids 1±166) termed ACE, proposed by Brizzio et al. (1998) to be involved in actin cytoskeleton organization and endocytosis, and a C-terminal region (amino acids 151±264) termed CF, proposed to be rather involved in cellular fusion. As preliminary experiments, both sub-domains of Rvs161p were cloned in the bait plasmid, the ACE domain was tested in a two-hybrid experiment against Rvs167p and Las17p, and the CF domain was tested against Fus2p. No positive reaction was noted, suggesting that the entire Rvs161p protein is necessary to physically interact with its protein partners. The lack of speci®c interaction of these domains against the candidates selected against the entire Rvs161p suggests that these domains could not be considered as structural domains supporting an interaction. Alternatively, this result could also mean that, as the screens were not exhaustive, recovery of speci®c interactants did not occur. Kap108p, a minor partner for Rvs161p, in terms of clone number, is a b-karyopherin. Its major role is nuclear export rather than import (Seedorf & Silver, 1997; Rosemblum et al., 1997, 1998; Pemberton et al., 1998). Some candidates interact with both Rvsp. All of them interact with the SH3 (or GPA+SH3) domain of Rvs167p. Rvs161p and the GPA+SH3 domain of Rvs167p interact with Las17p. The interaction between Rvs167p and Las17p has already been reported (Colwill et al., 1999; Madania et al., 1999), but not that between Rvs161p and Las17p, to our knowledge. The three other candidates, Ynl094p, Ymr192p and Ypl249p, have no known function. In Ynl094p, variations were observed in the results of the twohybrid assay, depending on the length of the coding sequence cloned in the prey vector. Four polypeptides located in the C-terminal region of the Ynl094p interact exclusively with the GPA+SH3 domain of Rvs167p, whereas two longer polypeptides interact with both Rvs167p and Rvs161p. In the Ymr192p and Ypl249p proteins, all polypeptides interact with Rvs161p and with the GPA+SH3 domain of Rvs167p. BLASTP (Altschul et al., 1990) searches revealed that both proteins are similar in a 200±230 amino acid region located between the 441 and 670 amino acids of Ypl249p and between the 290 and 520 amino acids of Ymr192p; this region is also similar to the Nterminal region of the Tre-2 oncogene product (Nakamura et al., 1992).

As a whole, our observations add further evidence for a general involvement of the amphiphysin/Rvs family in cell traf®cking and cell maintenance. The signi®cance of the numerous partners identi®ed in this work and involved in nucleuscytoplasmic traf®c is puzzling. Considering the role and localization of the orthologous BIN1 protein in mammals (Sakamuro et al., 1996; Wechsler-Reya et al., 1998), Rvs167p can also be involved in some way in nuclear functions, although no NLS sequence has been identi®ed in Rvs proteins. Finally, the huge imbalance between the number of candidates identi®ed as speci®c Rvs167p partners (24 ORFs) vs. those interacting with Rvs161p (two ORFs) could re¯ect the presence of the SH3 domain on the former protein, this domain perhaps generating interactants of no biological signi®cance.
