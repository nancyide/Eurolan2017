new class of proteins that function in the intracellular delivery of copper has recently been identified1­3. These metallochaperone proteins are necessary to activate copper-requiring enzymes because free copper concentrations in the cell are maintained at extremely low levels4. Eukaryotic copper chaperones include antioxidant protein 1 (Atx1), which delivers copper to vesicular transport ATPases2,5, the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS), which delivers copper to Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase I (SOD1)1,6, and cytochrome c oxidase assembly protein (Cox17), which delivers copper to cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondria7,8. These chaperones are highly specific for their individual target receptors. For example, yeast CCS (yCCS) is not required for copper trafficking to the secretory pathway or to the mitochondria, and overexpression of Atx1 in yeast cells lacking yCCS cannot restore copper incorporation into SOD11. While it has been shown that metal ion transfer from Atx1 to its

The positions of the yCCS secondary structure elements determined from the crystal structure are shown above the yCCS sequence. b-strands are shown as blue arrows, a-helices are shown as thick yellow lines, and loop regions are shown as thin gray lines. Residues that are identical in all four sequences are shown in red. Similar residues are shown in green. Residues involved in metal ion coordination are denoted by magenta asterisks. The SOD1 zinc subloop is enclosed in a red box, the SOD1 electrostatic channel binding loop is enclosed in a blue box, and residues involved in dimerization in CCS and SOD1 are enclosed in black boxes. Dimerization residues are defined as residues whose accessible surface area d ecreases by >1 Å2 upon dimer formation21.

sequences between yCCS and ySOD1 and between hCCS and hSOD1 (Figs 3b, 4). The overall sequence similarity between the entire SOD1-like domain of yCCS and full length ySOD1 is only 20%, compared to the 64% sequence similarity for the residues located at the dimer interface. The mean change in accessible surface area (DASA) per subunit21 upon dimer formation is 680 Å2, which is quite similar to the DASA for ySOD1 of 622 Å2 per monomer. Thus, the dimer interface in the yCCS structure resembles that in ySOD1 both in specific interacting residues and in overall size. Several differences in the dimer interfaces of yCCS and ySOD1 are notable, however. Two charged residues in yCCS, Lys 136 and Arg 217, have hydrophobic counterparts in ySOD1, Phe 51 and Leu 152 (Figs 3b, 4c, 4d). In hSOD1, mutation of Phe 51 to Glu results in the formation of a stable monomer22. These two positively charged residues, together with

ySOD1 and one monomer of yCCS. As mentioned above, the change in monomer accessible surface area upon dimerization is comparable for the two proteins, suggesting that a similarly sized interface could form in the heterodimer. In support of this model, metal ion removal is known to facilitate dissociation of the strongly associated SOD1 dimer to monomers24. Furthermore, gel filtration experiments indicate that apoyCCS is a monomer in solution (Pufahl, R.A. and O'Halloran, T.V., unpublished results). Residues in the dimer interface that are not conserved between the two proteins (shown in yellow in Fig. 4) are primarily pointing away from the interaction surface (Fig. 4c,d). Therefore, if one monomer of the ySOD1 dimer (Fig. 4c) is combined with the opposite half of the yCCS dimer (Fig. 4d), a model of the heterodimer can be built without any steric interference between the involved residues. In addition to these two possibilities, the disordered Cterminal 27 residues may also play a functional role. These residues are highly conserved between yCCS and hCCS (Fig. 3b) and include a CXC motif that could be involved in binding metal ions. In conclusion, yCCS has a modular structure that suggests a basis for specific recognition of ySOD1 by yCCS and provides new insight into possible molecular mechanisms of chaperone mediated

captoethanol. The crystals belong to the space group P21212 with unit cell dimensions a = 88.5 Å, b = 111.5 Å, and c = 52.9 Å, and there are two yCCS monomers in the asymmetric unit. Data collection, structural determination and refinement. Crystals were transferred either to precipitant solution containing 20% glycerol or to paratone N oil (Exxon), and flash cooled at -160 °C. Diffraction data were collected at the Dupont-Northwestern-Dow Collaborative Access Team (DND-CAT) beamline at the Advanced Photon Source using a 2k ´ 2k Mar CCD detector. Data for MAD phasing were collected at three different wavelengths using the reverse beam technique. All data were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK27. The selenium atoms were located by difference Patterson methods and initially refined with the program MLPHARE28. The selenium positions were further refined with the CNS program package29, and an initial electron density map was calculated at 2.5 Å resolution. This map allowed the unambiguous tracing of residues 5­94, 101­199, and 207­218 using the program O (ref. 30). The highresolution data set (1.8 Å) was then used for further cycles of model building and refinement with CNS. The higher resolution maps allowed the modeling of residues 2­4, 95­100, 200­206, and 219­222 as well as the addition of two sulfate ions and 352 water molecules. The C-terminal 27 residues are disordered and were not modeled. A Ramachandran plot generated with PROCHECK31 shows that the current model exhibits good geometry with 92.5% of the residues in the most favored regions and 7.5% of the residues in additional allowed regions. Figures were generated using MOLSCRIPT32 and RASTER3D33. The yCCS and ySOD1 dimer interfaces were analyzed using the Protein­Protein Interaction Server (http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/PP/server). Coordinates. The coordinates of yCCS have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (accession code 1qup).

Escherichia coli osmosensor EnvZ is a protein histidine kinase that plays a central role in osmoregulation, a cellular adaptation process involving the His-Asp phosphorelay signal transduction system. Dimerization of the transmembrane protein is essential for its autophosphorylation and phosphorelay signal transduction functions. Here we present the NMR-derived structure of the homodimeric core domain (residues 223­289) of EnvZ that includes His 243, the site of autophosphorylation and phosphate transfer reactions. The structure comprises a four-helix bundle formed by two identical helix-turn-helix subunits, revealing the molecular assembly of two active sites within the dimeric kinase. Histidine kinases play a major role in signal transduction that is essential for bacterial stress adaptation1. Escherichia coli has 32 histidine kinases2, many of which function as transmembrane signal sensors/transducers in response to specific external sig-
