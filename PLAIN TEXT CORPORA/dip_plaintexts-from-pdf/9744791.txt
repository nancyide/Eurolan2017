Abstract CSEI is essential for yeast cell viability and has been

implicated in chromosome segregation. Based on its sequence similarity, Cselp has been grouped into the family of importin like nucleocytoplasmic transport receptors with highest homology to the recently identified human nuclear export receptor for importin ~, CAS. We demonstrate here that Cselp physically interacts with yeast Ran and yeast importin tx (Srplp) in the yeast two-hybrid system and that recombinant Cselp, Srplp and Ran-GTP form a trimeric complex in vitro. Re-export of Srplp from the nucleus into the cytoplasm and nuclear uptake of a reporter protein containing a classical NLS are inhibited in a csel mutant strain. These findings suggest that Cselp is the exportin of importin ¢z in yeast. © 1998 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

1. Introduction Transport of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope occurs through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) and is an energy- and signal-dependent process depending on various transport factors (for review see [1-3]). Multiple transport pathways through the NPC have been identified whose specificity is ensured by nucleocytoplasmic transport receptors (collectively termed importins or exportins) which shuttle continuously between cytoplasm and nucleoplasm (for review see [4-6]). Binding and release of cargo to and from these receptors is regulated by the small Ras-like GTPase Ran which seems to be essential for most if not all nucleocytoplasmic transport pathways. Due to an asymmetric subcellular distribution of the only known RanGAP in the cytoplasm and the RanGEF in the nucleus, levels of the GTP-bound form of Ran are presumably rather low in the cytoplasm and high in the nucleus. This Ran-GTP gradient across the nuclear envelope together with intrinsic properties of nuclear import and export receptors (see below) is likely to ensure the directionality of nuclear transport (for review see [6,7]). Nuclear import and export receptors identified to date show sequence similarity to importin [3, the NPC-interacting subunit of the heterodimeric import receptor of proteins with a classical nuclear localization signal (NLS), importin ~[3 (for *Corresponding author.

review see [4,5]). The similarity is mainly found in a Ran-GTP bindirfg domain at the N-terminus of these proteins [8,9]. Binding of Ran-GTP has opposite effects on the binding of cargo by import and export receptors. Complexes between import receptors and cargo are dissociated by Ran-GTP, whereas binding of Ran-GTP and cargo to export receptors is cooperative. These properties of import and export receptors together with a high concentration of Ran-GTP in the nucleus trigger release of cargo from import receptors and association of cargo with export receptors in the nucleus. Release of export cargo and binding of import cargo in the cytoplasm is presumably dependent on another type of RanGTP binding domain present in a soluble Ran-GTP binding protein, RanBP1, and in some nucleoporins [10 13]. Characterized nuclear import and export receptors include, besides importin 13 (karyopherin [31) and its yeast homolog Kap95p [14-18], transportin (karyopherin [32) and yeast Kapl04p [19,20]), the import receptor for some hnRNP proteins, karyopherin [33 (yeast Pselp/Kapl21p) and [34 (yeast Yrb4p/Kap123p) [21-23], conferring nuclear import of ribosomal proteins, Mtrl0p [24,25], the nuclear import receptor for the yeast hnRNP protein Npl3p, Sxmlp [26], mediating nuclear import of the yeast La homolog, CRM1 (yeast Xpolp) [27-30], the export receptor for proteins containing a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES), and hLOS1 and yeast Loslp [31-33]), an export receptor for tRNA (for more references see [4,5]). Another member of this protein family, CAS, previously implicated in apoptosis [34] was recently shown to confer the re-export of importin c~, the NLS binding subunit of the NLS receptor (importin ~[3), from the nucleus into the cytoplasm [35]. The shuttling of importin c~ between nucleus and cytoplasm is thus mediated by two different members of the nuclear transport receptor family, importin [3 and CAS (for review see [6]). On its import route into the nucleus, importin c~ serves as an adaptor for proteins containing a classical NLS. It is not known, however, whether importin a is bound to any substrate on its way out of the nucleus. Based on the identification of a nuclear complex between yeast importin c~, Srplp, and the yeast cap binding protein complex (CBC), it was suggested that importin a plays a role in U snRNA export [36]. Based on sequence similarity, a number of additional members of the nuclear transport receptor family have been suggested, but their function in nuclear transport remains to be shown and their substrate to be identified. One of these proteins, Cselp, was previously identified in a genetic screen for mutations that affect chromosome segregation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [37]. The CSE1 gene is essential for yeast cell viability and encodes a 109 kDa protein with 36% overall identity to human CAS [34] as compared to 18% identity to importin [3. Isolation of SRP1 encoding yeast importin c~, as a multicopy suppressor of a csel mutation [37], localization of

186 Cselp to the nuclear periphery (cited in [381) and binding of Cselp to Ran-GTP in an overlay assay [9] provided circumstantial evidence that the sequence similarity to CAS might be functionally relevant. Here, we show that Cselp physically interacts with Srplp and Ran in vivo and in vitro. Using recombinant proteins from Escherichia coli, a trimeric complex between Cselp, Srplp and Ran-GTP could be formed. In addition, a mutation in the CSE1 gene leads to nuclear accumulation of Srplp and cytoplasmic accumulation of a NLScontaining nuclear reporter protein. Taken together these results suggest that Cselp is the functional homologue of CAS in S. cerevisiae.

Hurt/FEBS Letters 433 (1998) 185-190 teins, strain JTY2500 harboring the E. eoli lacZ gene under the control of eight LexA binding sites was cotransformed with the appropriate pBTM116- and pGAD424-based plasmids. Transformants were grown in SDC-Leu-Trp medium to late exponential phase (A60~,,,," 2) and assayed for ~-galactosidase activity using the chromogenic substrate, CPRG (Boehringer Mannheim) [53]. The amount of CPR liberated was followed by the increase in absorbance at 574 nm and was normalized to cell number (A6D0nm) , culture volume, and reaction time. Values shown are means of three independent cultivations of three different transformants for each combination tested. The standard deviations of the mean were less than 25% and are indicated by error bars. 2.4. Expression and purification of recombinant proteins For the expression of (His)6-Cselp and GST-Srplp in E. coli, plasmids pET9dt-CSE1 and pNOY3198 were transformed into BL31(DE3) or DH5c~ cells, respectively. Transformants were grown in 400 ml LB complete medium [44] at 30°C to OD~00 0.5, shifted to 23°C and induced by the addition of 0.5 mM IPTG. The bacterial cell pellet was lysed by sonication in l0 ml of universal buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.0, 100 mM KOAc, 2 mM Mg(OAc)2, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol) containing 5 mM [~-mercaptoethanol and 1 tablet of Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mix (Boehringer Mannheim) per 50 ml. In case of BL21(DE3) 20 mM imidazole was added to the buffer to reduce unspecific binding of E. eoli proteins during subsequent application to the NF+-NTA resin (Qiagen). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 100000×g for 1 h and applied to 200 ~1 of Ni2+-NTA resin or glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia), respectively, in a 15 ml Poly-prep column (Bio-Rad). Binding was performed for 1 h at 4°C on a turning wheel. Bound proteins were washed three times with 5 ml universal buffer (+40 mM imidazole in case of the Ni2+-NTA column) and eluted with 500 gl universal buffer containing 500 mM imidazole or 10 mM reduced glutathione (Sigma), respectively. Eluted proteins were stored at -70°C in 50 ~1 aliquots. 2.5. In vitro protein interaction assay Per assay, 25 gl (~30 mg) purified GST-Srplp in a total of 500 gl universal buffer were rebound to 20 gl glutathioneoSepharose in a spin column (Mobicol; MoBiTec) for 30 min at 4°C on a turning wheel. Beads were washed three times with 500 p.l universal buffer before adding purified (His)~-Cselp (50 ~tl; ~ 10 rag) and human RanQ69L (2 lal; ~ l0 rag) either in its GDP- or GTP-bound form in a total volume of 200 gl universal buffer. Mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 4°C on a turning wheel. Unbound proteins were collected by centrifugation, beads were washed three times with 500 gl universal buffer and bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in 50 gl SDS sample buffer. Unbound (40 gl) and bound proteins (20 p~l) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining. 2.6. Miscellaneous SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were done using standard protocols [54]. Immune complexes on blots were visualized using a commercial chemiluminescence detection system (ECE; Amersham) and X-ray film (Biomax; Kodak). Fluorescence microscopy of living yeast cells expressing GFP fusion proteins was done according to [55]. 3. Results

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Strains and growth conditions Yeast strains Y1709 (MATa ura3-52 his3-11,15 trpl-A901 ade2-101 csel-1) and JTY2500 (MATa ura3-52 his3-A200 1eu2-3,112 trpl-A901 canR gal4-542 gal80-538 ADE2:.'PGAL-URA3 LYS2:.'lexop-lacZ) have been described earlier [37,39]. Unless indicated otherwise, yeast cells were grown at 30°C in YPD complete medium or SDC synthetic complete medium according to [40]. Yeast transformations were performed using a modified form of the lithium acetate method [41]. E. co//strain DH5a [42] was used for propagation of plasmids and protein expression controlled by the tac promoter (see below). Strain BL21(DE3) [43] was used for protein expression controlled by the bacteriophage T7 promoter (see below). Bacteria were cultivated and transformed using standard methods [44]. 2.2. Plasmids Standard techniques were used for the isolation and manipulation of recombinant DNA [44,45]. PCR amplifications were performed using Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The CSE1 gene was subcloned as a genomic HindIII/SacI fragment from plasmid 21-3 (provided by Stefan Irniger, Institut ftir Mikrobiologic und Genetik, G6ttingen, Germany) on pRS316 yielding plasmid pMK330. E. coli expression plasmid pET9dt-CSE1 encoding (His)~ epitope tagged Cselp under the control of the bacteriophage T7 promoter contains a PCR-generated NcoI/BamHI fragment comprising the entire ORF on a modified version of plasmid pET9d (Gunter Stier, EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany). SRP1 constructs were derived from plasmid pNOY162 [46]. Plasmid pMK286 containing a SRP1GFP fusion was constructed by inserting a BamHI GFP cassette [47] into a PCR-generated BgllI site immediately upstream of the STOP codon of SRP1 on pNOYI62. E. coli expression plasmid pNOY3198 encoding a GST-Srplp fusion protein under the control of the tac promoter has been described earlier [48]. GSP1 constructs were derived from plasmid YEp352-GSP1 [49]. A plasmid encoding a GFPNp13(284-414) fusion protein comprising the NLS of Npl3p under the control of the constitutive NOP1 promoter has been described earlier [25]. The construction of a fusion gene between GFP and the entire open reading frame of RPL25 encoding the ribosomal protein L25 on pRS314 will be described elsewhere (S. Hannus, B. Schmelzl, G. Simos and E. Hurt, in preparation). Plasmid pMK284 carrying a YRB1GFP fusion on pRS314 has been described previously [33]. A PstI/ EcoRl fragment comprising a ADH1-SV40~Ls.-GAL4TA:)-GFP fusion gene was recloned from plasmid pGADGFP [50] onto ADE2-vector pASZll [51] (Jun Katahira, unpublished). Fusions of various genes to the DBD of E. coli LexA protein and the TAD of yeast Gal4p were constructed by amplifying fragments comprising the entire ORFs including suitable cloning sites at the ends by PCR and inserting the PCR-generated fragments into the corresponding sites of two-hybrid vectors pBTM116 and pGAD424 [52], respectively. Resulting plasmids were pMK151 (pGAD424-SRP1), pMKI78 (pGAD424-GSP1), pMKI99 (pGAD424-YRB1) and pMK326 (pBTMll6-CSE1). Plasmid pMK220 (pBTMl16-KAP95) contains a BamHI fragment comprising the entire ORF of KAP95 from pGEX4T3-~I 861 [17]. 2.3. Two-hybrid protein interaction assay To assess interactions between LeXADBDand Gal4~rADfusion pro-

If Cselp acts as the nuclear export receptor for importin ct in yeast, it should interact with its cargo and the regulatory factor Ran. To assess an interaction between these proteins in vivo, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system. The entire open reading frame of the CSE1 gene was fused to the DNA binding domain (DBD) of LexA (see Section 2). This fusion protein was assayed for interaction with fusions of fulllength Srplp (yeast importin c0 and Gsplp (yeast Ran) to the transcription activation domain (TAD) of Gal4p. An analogous fusion of Yrblp (yeast RanBP1) to the Gal4TAD and the empty vector expressing the Gal4TAD alone served as controls. The same Gal4TAD constructs were tested for interaction with


M. Kiinzler, E.C. Hurt/FEBS Letters 433 (1998) 185-190 a fusion protein of the entire open reading frame of Kap95p (yeast importin ~) to the LeXADBD. Plasmids encoding the various fusion proteins were introduced into a reporter strain harboring a chromosomal E. coli lacZ gene under the control of eight LexA binding sites. Interaction between the various fusion proteins was monitored by determining the [3-galactosidase activities of transformants harboring the corresponding plasmids. The results are summarized in Fig. 1. Using this assay, a distinct interaction of Cselp with Srplp and Gsplp was detected. It should be noted that the GaI4TAD-Yrblp fusion protein used here as a negative control shows a strong interaction with a LexADBD-Gsplp fusion protein under the same conditions (data not shown). Significantly, Kap95p shows essentially the same interaction pattern as Cselp in this assay. In summary, like Kap95p, Cselp specifically interacts with Srplp and Gsplp in the two-hybrid system. 3.2. Cselp, Srplp and Ran-GTP.form a trimeric complex in vitro All nuclear export receptors tested so far, CRMI [27], CAS [35] and hLOS1 [31,32], form trimeric export complexes between receptor, cargo and Ran-GTP. Only weak binding or no binding of the export cargo to the export receptor was observed in the absence of Ran-GTP. In order to test whether Cselp, Srplp and Ran can form such a trimeric complex in vitro, we performed solution binding assays using recombinant proteins. For this purpose, we purified (His)6-Cselp and GST-Srplp from E. coil using respective affinity matrices (see Section 2). For the binding assay, GST-Srpl was rebound to glutathione-sepharose beads and incubated with approximately equal amounts of affinity-purified (His)6-Cselp and human RanQ69L (Fig. 2). RanQ69L is a mutant form of Ran whose GTP-bound form is stabilized due to a defect in

Recombinant Cselp, GST-Srpl and human Ran in its GDPand GTP-bound form were purified from E. coli as described in Section 2. GST-Srplp was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia), washed and incubated with buffer (lanes 2 and 6), Cselp (lanes 3 and 7), Cselp+Ran-GDP (lanes 4 and 8) and Cselp+Ran-GTP (lanes 5 and 9). Unbound proteins were collected, beads were washed and bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in SDS sample buffer. Unbound and bound protein fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining (see Section 2). To visualize bound Ran, an immunoblot of the bound fractions (10 gl) was performed using a polyclonal rabbit antiserum against human Ran. Bands marked with filled circles in the unbound fractions are copurifying proteins from E. coli, whereas analogously marked bands in the bound fraction represent degradation products of Srplp.

GTP hydrolysis. The protein can, however, be loaded like wild-type Ran with either GDP or GTP (kindly provided by Ralf Bischoff, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg). After incubation of the protein mixtures for 1 h at 4°C, unbound and bound fractions were analyzed by SDSPAGE and Coomassie blue staining. Clearly, binding of Srplp to Cselp was only observed in the presence of RanGTP, but not Ran-GDP (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 9). In the bound fractions, Ran was detected by immunoblotting using a polyclonal anti-human Ran antiserum. This indicates the formation of a trimeric complex between Cselp, Srplp and RanGTP. 3.3. Srplp and a nuclear reporter protein containing a classical NLS are mislocalized in a cold-sensitive csel mutant In order to test whether Cselp acts as a nuclear export receptor for importin a in vivo, we analyzed the subcellular localization of a functional, plasmid-encoded Srpl-GFP fusion protein in a cold-sensitive csel-1 mutant strain carrying in addition either the wild-type CSE1 gene on a plasmid or the corresponding empty vector (see Section 2). Cells were grown in liquid medium at semi-permissive temperature (23°C) and viewed directly by fuorescence microscopy. Clearly, the cold-sensitive mutation in CSE1 caused a strong mislocalization of Srplp-GFP to the nucleoplasm (Fig. 3A D). In a wild-type strain, Srplp-GFP is found both in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm, with an increased, punctate labeling at the nuclear envelope. This intracellular distribution of Srplp-GFP differs slightly from published localization studies using indirect immunofluorescencemicroscopy which detected Srplp either exclusively cytoplasmic, nucleoplasmic or at the

nuclear envelope depending on the experimental conditions [18,56-59]. The differences maybe due to different fixation procedures for immunofluorescence or the method of detec-

tion. In a csel-1 mutant strain, the cytoplasmic and nuclear envelope staining were clearly reduced and the nucleoplasmic signal accordingly increased. As controls for the specificity of this nuclear export defect, we analyzed, under the same conditions, the steady-state localization of ribosomal protein L25 fused to GFP (L25-GFP) (Fig. 3E-H) and of a Yrbl-GFP (Fig. 3I-L) fusion protein. Both fusion proteins complement, like Srpl-GFP, respective null mutants and exhibit a cytoplasmic localization in a wild-type strain ([33]; S. Hannus, B. Schmelzl, G. Simos and E. Hurt, in preparation). Yrbl-GFP was used since there is evidence that Yrblp shuttles continuously, like Srplp, between nucleus and cytoplasm [22], but exploits other exportins for exit from the nucleus (M. Ktinzler and E. Hurt, in preparation). L25-GFP was used since this ribosomal protein is first imported into the nucleolus where it


M. Kiinzler, E.C. Hurt/FEBS Letters 433 (1998) 185-190 assembles into ribosomal particles which are then exported into the cytoplasm [60]. L25 uses distinct importins for its nuclear uptake [22] and the exportins for ribosomal particles are not yet known. The localization of both reporters, L25GFP and YrbI-GFP, was completely unaffected by the csel-I mutation. In addition to these controls, we also performed in situ-hybridization of poly(A)+ RNA in the csel-1 mutant cells and could not detect any increase in the number of cells showing nuclear accumulation as compared to wild-type cells (data not shown). Poly(A)+ RNA normally gives a cytoplasmic signal under steady-state conditions and is presumably exported from the nucleus via pathways different from Srplp (for review see [3,61]). It should be noted in addition that, in contrast to GFP fusion proteins containing leucine-rich NESs, the Srpl-GFP fusion protein is not mislocalized in strains mutated in the gene encoding the nuclear export receptor for NESs of this type, XPOI [28,62] (data not shown). In agreement with a mislocalization of the receptor for classical NLSs, Srplp, a GFP fusion protein containing such a NLS, SV40NI~s-GaI4rAD-GFP (SV40NLs-GFP), was significantly mislocalized to the cytoplasm in the csel-1 mutant strain (Fig. 3M-P). The nuclear pool of SV40r%s-GFP observed in a wild-type background was reduced and the cytoplasmic pool accordingly increased. By contrast, the localization of GFP-NpI3(284-414) (GFP-NpI3Ncs) (Fig. 3Q-T) was unaffected by the csel-I mutation as compared to the wildtype situation. This control was chosen since Npl3p shuttles continuously, like Srplp, between nucleus and cytoplasm [63], but exploits a different importin for its nuclear import, Mtrl0p [24,25]. For recognition by Mtrl0p the C-terminal 130 amino acids (residues 284414) were shown to be necessary and sufficient [25]. It should be noted that the observed mislocalization of Srplp and SV40NLs-GFP in a csel-I mutant strain at 23°C did not change significantly by shifting the cells to lower (16°C) or higher temperatures (30°C, 37°C) (data not shown). 4. Discussion Importin ~[3 is the heterodimeric nuclear import receptor for proteins that contain a classical NLS [15,16]. Both subunits shuttle continuously between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Recently, CAS, a protein previously implicated in apoptosis [34], was identified as the nuclear export receptor for importin ~ [35]. The data presented here suggest that Cselp is the functional homologue of CAS in the yeast S. cerevisiae and thus is the exportin for yeast importin e~. (i) Cselp associates, both in vivo and in vitro, with its export cargo Srplp and the regulator of export, Gsplp or Ran, respectively; (ii) the in vitro binding studies show that binding of Cselp to Ran is specific for the GTP-bound form of Ran as shown previously by overlay assays [9]; (iii) the binding of Cselp to Ran-GTP is cooperative with the binding of Cselp to Srplp demonstrated by the formation of a trimeric complex between Cselp, Srplp and Ran-GTP. Analogous complexes have been demonstrated for CRM1 [27], the human Los lp homologue [31,32] and CAS [35]; (iv) subcellular localization studies in living yeast cells show that Srplp, which under steady-state conditions is found in the cytoplasm, nucleoplasm and at NPCs, accumulates in the nucleus of a cold-sensitive csel-1 mutant at semi-permissive temperature. Under the same conditions, a reporter protein containing a 189 classical NLS is mislocalized to the cytoplasm suggesting that Srplp becomes limiting in the cytoplasm for import of such NLSs. Previous isolation of the SRP1 gene as a multicopy suppressor of the csel-I mutation is in accordance with such an interpretation [37]. Other nuclear export and import pathways such as exit of L25-GFP and YrbI-GFP from the nucleus, and nuclear uptake of Npl3p which uses Mtrl0p as importin [24,25], respectively, are not affected in a csel-I mutant. Although our data suggest that Cselp functions as a specific nuclear export receptor for Srplp, it is possible that Srplp is not the only export substrate of Cselp and that additional proteins are exported via this pathway. Such proteins could possibly be identified by their primary sequence once the NES in Srplp is characterized. Preliminary results suggest that the N-terminal IBB-domain of Srplp which is necessary and sufficient for interaction with Kap95p [64-66] is dispensable for binding to Cselp (M. Kiinzler and E. Hurt, unpublished results) consistent with a recent study in higher eukaryotes [67]. This suggests that the NLS and NES are in separate domains of Srplp. Candidate alternative substrates of Cselp are proteins involved in mitosis given the strong defects of a csel-1 mutation in chromosome segregation [37]. In accordance with these defects, another mutation, csel-22, was reported to inhibit degradation of B-type cyclins [38]. However, this mutation turned out to be located in APCIO, a neighboring gene of CSE! encoding a component of the anaphase-promoting complex [68]. Consistent with the phenotype of the csel-1 mutation, however, CAS was also implicated in mitosis of higher eukaryotic cells [69]. Alternatively to a defective nuclear export, the observed defects of mutations in Cselp/CAS in mitosis could also be the consequence of a defective nuclear import of proteins involved in mitosis that contain a classical NLS. This explanation seems reasonable given the fact that the mitotic spindle in S. cerevisiae remains intranuclear due to the absence of nuclear envelope breakdown [70]. Indeed, point mutations in SRP1 that reduce NLS binding [46,50] and depletion of Srplp have been reported to cause similar defects in mitosis such as stabilization of B-type cyclins, cell cycle arrest at G2/M, aberrant spindles and chromosome segregation [57,71]. Formally, as a third explanation for the observed mitotic defects, we cannot exclude that, in addition to its role as a nucleocytoplasmic export factor, Cselp/CAS has additional roles in the cell, e.g. in mitosis. In this regard, it might be interesting that CAS was found in association with the mitotic spindle in higher eukaryotes [72].
