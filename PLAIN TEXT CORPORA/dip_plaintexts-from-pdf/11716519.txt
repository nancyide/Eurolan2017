The Saccharomyces cerevisiae dual-specificity protein phosphatase Yvh1p, identified as vaccinia VH1 homolog, regulates cell growth, sporulation, and glycogen accumulation. Transcription of YVH1 is induced by lowering temperature and nitrogen starvation. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we searched for Yvh1p-interacting proteins, including substrates and regulatory subunits of Yvh1p. Two clones were identified encoding a segment of YPH1 (yeast pescadillo homolog), which is essential for cell cycle progression in yeast. Deletion analysis revealed that the catalytic domain of Yvh1p and the BRCT domain of Yph1p are sufficient for this interaction. We found that the multicopy of YPH1 not only suppressed slow growth but also decreased IME2 expression in the yvh1 disruptant. These observations indicate that Yph1p plays a role in sporulation in addition to cell cycle progression, and is a candidate for a substrate or a regulatory Key Words: dual-specificity protein phosphatase; YVH1; yeast pescadillo homolog; YPH1; Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation plays an important role in regulating many cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell cycle progression and gene expression (1). Phosphorylation by protein kinases (PKases) can be reversed by the action of protein phosphatases (PPases). PPases are classified into three classes: protein-serine/threonine phosphatases (PSPases) that hydrolyze phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues of proteins, protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) that hydrolyze a phosphotyrosine residue of proteins, and dual-specificity protein phosphatases (DSPs).

emerging family of PPases that can hydrolyze both phosphoserine/threonine and phosphotyrosine (2). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Yvh1p is the first eukaryotic member of the DSP family and was identified as a vaccinia VH1 homolog (3). Sequence homologs of Yvh1p have been identified in some organisms: yvh1 / SPAC17A3.06 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, C24F3.2 in Caenorhabditis elegans and DUSP12/hYVH1 in Homo sapiens (see YPD; http://www.proteome.com). However, the physiological role of all Yvh1p homologs is unknown. Yvh1p possesses a catalytic domain containing a highly conserved active site with the consensus motif [I/V]HCXAGXXR[S/T]G (where X is any amino acid) present in PTPs and DSPs (4) and a non-catalytic C-terminus encoding a zinc finger motif that is known for its role in mediating multiprotein complex assembly (5). Deletion of YVH1 causes defects in vegetative growth, particularly at lowering temperature, sporulation and glycogen accumulation (3, 6­8). Interestingly, transcription of YVH1 is induced by low temperature and nitrogen starvation (3, 6). Sporulation defect observed in the yvh1 disruptant correlated with the decrease in the expression of IME1 and IME2, which encode two critical transcription factors of sporulation-specific genes (7). Since the multicopy of a sporulation-promoting factor MCK1 suppressed the sporulation defect of the yvh1 disruptant, Mck1p is suggested to be situated downstream of Yvh1p in sporulation (9). In one other report (8), the reducing cAMP levels by overexpression of PDE1 and PDE2 encoding the phosphodiesterases suppressed the phenotypes associated with sporulation and glycogen accumulation of the yvh1 disruptant. Therefore, Yvh1p is suggested to participate in the cAMP-PKA cascade (8). Although Yvh1p is involved in several cellular processes, proteins interacting with Yvh1p, such as substrates and regulatory subunits, remain unknown. To identify proteins physically interacting with Yvh1p, we carried out two-hybrid screening of Yvh1p

as a bait and obtained two positive clones. Both clones encoded a segment of YPH1 (yeast pescadillo homolog), which is essential for cell cycle progression (10). In this communication, we show that the catalytic domain of Yvh1p interacts with the BRCT domain (BRAC1 C-terminal domain) (11) of Yph1p. YPH1 on multicopy plasmid suppresses slow growth and decreased IME2 expression in the yvh1 disruptant. We suggest that Yph1p acts downstream of Yvh1p in vegetative growth and sporulation and is a candidate for a substrate or a regulatory subunit of Yvh1p.

For two-hybrid screening, the reporter strain L40 (MATa his3 200 trp1-901 leu23,112 ade2 LYS2 (lexAop)4-HIS3 URA3 (lexAop)8-lacZ gal4 gal80) was used. Escherichia coli DH5 was used for the construction and preparation of plasmid DNA. The standard complete medium of S. cerevisiae, YPDA, consisted of 1% yeast extract, 2% polypepton, 2% glucose and 0.04% adenine. SC medium consisted of 2% glucose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco Laboratories, MI, USA) and the required auxotrophic supplements. X-gal plates were prepared as follows: 900 ml of the basal medium containing 2% glucose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, the required auxotrophic supplements and 2% agar was mixed with 100 ml of 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) after autoclaving, and then 0.4 ml of 20 mg/ml X-gal (5bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl- -D-galactopyranoside in N,N-dimethylformamide) was added. YPAc medium consisted of 2% potassium acetate, 2% bacto-peptone (Difco Laboratories), 1% yeast extract and 0.04% adenine. Sporulation medium consisted of 2% potassium acetate. Plasmids. The pUC-YVH1 plasmid containing the entire YVH1 (nucleotide positions 1170 to 1190 relative to ATG) was constructed by insertion of PCR product amplified with primers (5 CTCGTCGACCTCCAATTGGCAAAGAATAT and 5 CTCGTCGACCTCAGCACCAAAATTCATCT) into pUC119 after digestion with SalI. To generate pBS-YVH1C117S containing the mutation allele YVH1C117S where cysteine at 117 is converted to serine, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the LA PCR in vitro mutagenesis kit (TaKaRa, Kyoto, Japan). Primer R1 (5 TCCTGCTTGAGAATGAGCAA) containing the underlined mutation was designed from cysteine 117 to serine (nucleotide positions 349 to 351). Template plasmid pBS-YVH1X was constructed by inserting the wild-type 1.4 kb XhoI fragment ( 1022 to 367 of YVH1) of pUC-YVH1 into the XhoI site of pBluescript II SK( ). PCR was performed according to the protocols of the kit. The resultant PCR products, which consisted of the 1.4 kb XhoI fragment of YVH1C117S ( 1022 to 367) with multicloning sites from pBluescript II SK( ) at both ends, were doubly cleaved with BamHI and ApaI and inserted into the BamHI­ApaI gap of pBluescript II SK( ), generating plasmid pBS-YVH1C117SX. Mutation was verified by sequence analysis. A plasmid containing full-length YVH1C117S (pBS-YVH1C117S) was constructed as follows: 0.8 kb XhoI-SalI fragment of pUC-YVH1 containing the region from positions 363 to 1190 of YVH1 was inserted into the XhoI site of pBluescript II SK( ), generating plasmid pBS-YVH1C363. Then, the 1.4 kb XhoI fragment ( 1022 to 367 of YVH1C117S) of pBS-YVH1C117SX was inserted into the XhoI site of pBS-YVH1C363 to create pBS-YVH1C117S. pLexA-YVH1 and pLexA-YVH1C117S were constructed as follows:

1073), and pUC-YVH1 or pBS-YVH1C117S as template, respectively. The resultant PCR products were doubly digested with BamHI and SalI and inserted into the BamHI-SalI gap of pBTM116a. pBTM116a was constructed by insertion of 8 mer linker, pBamHI (TaKaRa) into the SmaI site of pBTM116 (13). Plasmid pBTMYVH1N containing the N-terminal catalytic domain of YVH1 was constructed as follows: a 0.6 kb fragment of the N-terminal catalytic domain of YVH1 was amplified by PCR using primers YVH1f and YVH1Nr (5 -GAGCTGCAGTTATCCAGAATTGGAGACCAATT, 615 to 596). The resultant PCR product was doubly digested with BamHI and PstI and inserted into the BamHI-PstI gap of pBTM116a. Plasmid pBTM-YVHC containing the C-terminal fragment of YVH1 was constructed by cleaving the pBTM-YVH1 with BamHI and BglII and self-ligating to remove the 0.3 kb N-terminal fragment. Plasmid pACT-YPH1 was constructed by cloning the entire coding region ( 1 to 1815) of YPH1 as follows: YPH1 was amplified by PCR using primers YGR103w( 1)f (5 -CTCGGATCCATGAGAATCAAGAAGAAAAA, 1 to 20) and YGR103w( 1815)r (5 CTCCTCGAGTTTCTTGGAATCTAGTTTAT, 1796 to 1815), and genomic DNA of W303-1A as template. The resultant PCR products were cleaved with BamHI and XhoI and inserted into the same gap of pACT200. pACT200 was constructed by insertion of 8 mer linker, pBamHI (TaKaRa) into the SmaI site of pACTII (14). The N-terminal domain of YPH1 was amplified by PCR using primers YGR103w( 1)f and YGR103wNr (5 -CGCCTCGAGAGGTCACCCTTGTTCTTATTGT, 1032 to 1013). The resultant PCR product was cleaved with BamHI and XhoI and inserted into the same gap of pACT200 to create pACTYPH1N. The BRCT domain of YPH1 was amplified by PCR using primers YGR103wBRCTf (5 -CGCGGATCCATCTTAATACAGCCAAGTAA, 1033 to 1052) and YGR103wBRCTr (5 TATCTCGAGTGGGCTTAAGTGAGGTGGAA, 1377 to 1358). The resultant PCR product was cleaved with BamHI and XhoI and inserted into the same gap of pACT200 to create pACT-YPH1BRCT. The C-terminal domain of YPH1 was amplified by PCR using primers YGR103w( 1378)f (5 -GCGGTCGACTTGGGGTGATGCTATTGGTTA, 1378 to 1397) and YGR103w( 1815)r. The resultant PCR product was cleaved with SalI and XhoI and inserted into the XhoI site of pACT200 to create pACT-YPH1C. YIp-YGR103w TRP1 was constructed as follows: YPH1 was amplified by PCR using primers YGR103w( 1)f and YGR103w( 1815)r. The PCR products were cloned into the pT7BlueR vector (Novagen Inc., WI, USA) to create pT7-YPH1. The 1.2 kb BamHI-BglII fragment containing TRP1 from YRp7 (15) was inserted into the BglII site of pT7-YPH1 to create YIp-YGR103w TRP1. Plasmids YEpL-YPH1, YEpU-YPH1 and YCpU-YPH1 were constructed by cloning a 2.3 kb BamHI-XhoI fragment ( 500 to 1908) amplified by PCR using primers YPH( 500)f (5 GCGGGATCCAGCTTCAGCAGACGGTGGCT, 500 to 481) and YGR103w( 1908)r (5 -CTCCTCGAGTAATGTTGCTATACCGAGGA, 1889 to 1908), and genomic DNA of W303-1A as template into the same gap of pRS425, pRS426 and pRS316 (16, 17), respectively. Plasmids YEpL-YVH1 and YEpU-YVH1 were constructed by cloning a 1.4 kb Sph1­SalI fragment ( 300 to 1190) amplified by PCR using primers YVH1( 300)f (5 CTCGCATGCGACGTTAAACTAAAGTTGCA, 300 to 281) and YVH1( 1190)r (5 -CTCGTCGACCTCAGCACCAAAATTCATCT, 1171 to 1190), and pUC-YVH1 as template into the same gap of pRS425 and pRS426, respectively. Two-hybrid screening. The S. cerevisiae strain L40 harboring lexAop-lacZ and lexAop-HIS3 reporters was first transformed with pLexA-Yvh1C117S, which expresses full-length Yvh1C117Sp fused to LexA. L40 containing pLexA-Yvh1C117S was further transformed with a library of fusions between the Gal4 activation domain (GAD) and S.

cerevisiae cDNA fragment (18). Positive clones were identified by histidine prototrophy on the plates deficient in histidine and containing 30 mM 3-amino 1,2,4-triazole (AT) based upon the activation of the HIS3 reporter and the assay for the lacZ reporter activity by monitoring blue color developed on X-gal plates. Plasmid DNAs were recovered from positive clones by transforming E. coli and the nucleotide sequences of the insert DNA were determined by the dyeterminator method with the ABI PRISM 310 sequencing system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using a primer from the GAL4 region. Construction of disruptant of YVH1 and YPH1. The yvh1 disruptants YPA18H and YPB18H were constructed by replacing YVH1 of W303-1A and W303-1B with CgHIS3 using the PCR-mediated method as described (6). To construct the yph1 disruptant, the 3.0 kb BamHI­XhoI fragment from YIp-YGR103w TRP1 was introduced into the W303 diploid strain. Southern blot analysis (19) was performed on Trp transformants to confirm that one copy of the endogenous YPH1 was disrupted. A 1.8-kb YPH1 fragment amplified by PCR using primers YGR103w( 1)f and YGR103w( 1815)r was used as a probe. The diploid strain containing the disrupted YPH1 was subsequently transformed with YCpU-YPH1 and the resultant Ura transformants were sporulated and dissected. One Ura Trp seg-

Northern blot hybridization analysis. Preparation of RNA and the method for Northern blot hybridization were as described (20). Cells were pregrown to exponential phase ( A660 1.0) in YPAc medium. The cells were then harvested, washed with sterile water, transferred to an equal volume of sporulation medium and incubated at 30°C for an additional 4 h. Total RNA was prepared from each of cell cultures at 0 h (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7) and 4 h (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8) after a shift to sporulation medium. DNA probes containing IME2 ORF ( 1 to 1112) and ACT1 ORF ( 450 to 776) were synthesized by PCR and labeled with [ -32P]dCTP according to the protocols of the random primer DNA labeling kit ver.2 (TaKaRa). RESULTS Identification of a Protein That Interacts with Yvh1p in Two-Hybrid System It has been shown in PTPs and DSPs that alteration of the cysteine residue to serine in the consensus motif of the phosphatase domain reduces phosphatase activity (21, 22) and allows some PTPs and DSPs to be isolated in the form of a complex with their substrate (23). This mutant is called "substrate-trapping mutant" and the use of this mutant appears to be a promising approach to isolate the interacting proteins. The substrate-trapping mutant of YVH1 (YVH1C117S), a mutant of cysteine 117 to serine, was fused to a bacterial DNA-binding domain of LexA of pBTM116a. Using the LexA-Yvh1C117Sp as a bait, we screened a library of GAD fusions to S. cerevisiae cDNA in the two-hybrid system to identify the interacting proteins of Yvh1p (see Materials and Methods). Among approximately 560,000 independent transformants, we isolated two His clones grown on SC-TrpLeuHis 30 mM AT (Fig. 1). These two His clones were examined for the activation of LacZ reporter gene. Colonies of the His clones and those of the L40 strain with either LexAYvh1C117Sp and control GAD, or controls LexA and GAD were replicated onto X-gal plates. Colonies of the His

In clones #1, GAD is fused to Yph1p at amino acid 202 and contains amino acids 202 to 605. In clone #2, GAD is fused to Yph1p at amino acid 212 and contains amino acids 212 to 491. The BRCT domain is indicated by a black bar. (B) Yvh1C117S interacts with Yph1 in the two-hybrid system. Vector and Yvh1C117S in the column headed by LexA denote plasmids that express LexA and LexA-Yvh1C117S, respectively. Vector, clone #1 and clone #2 in the column headed by GAD denote a vector plasmid that expresses GAD and plasmids #1 and #2 isolated by two-hybrid screening. Transformants of L40 carrying each pair of the plasmids were grown on SC-TrpLeu plates and their cells were spotted onto a SC-TrpLeuHis 5 mM AT plate and an X-gal plate.

clones turned blue on the X-gal plate whereas those of controls remain white, indicating that these two His clones were positive for activation of LacZ as well as HIS3 reporter. Sequence analysis of the cDNA inserts in the two positive clones revealed that these carried GAD fusions to the sequence YPH1/YGR103w: clone #1 contained amino acids 202 to 605, and clone #2 contained amino acids 212 to 491 of an open reading frame consisting of 605 amino acid residues (Fig. 1). The YPH1 has been reported to be a yeast pescadillo homolog (10). The pescadillo gene was initially identified through an embryonic mutation in zebrafish (24). Other sequence homologs of pescadillo have also been identified, i.e., Spbc19f5.05cp in S. pombe (25), R13A5.12 in C. elegans (see Saccharomyces genome database (SGD)), and PES1 in H. sapiens (see SGD). The molecular functions of the homologs are unclear

FIG. 2. Identification of the Yvh1p region required for its interaction with Yph1p. (A) Schematic map of the Yvh1p derivatives encoded in plasmids. Yvh1p consists of 364 amino acids. Yvh1C117S is a mutant allele in which cysteine at amino acid 117 was replaced by serine. Yvh1cat and Yvh1C correspond to amino acids 1 to 205 and 124 to 364 of Yvh1p, respectively. The catalytic domain is indicated by a gray bar. The zinc-finger domain is indicated by a shaded bar. (B) Vector, clone #1 and clone #2 in the column headed by GAD denote a vector plasmid that expresses GAD and plasmids #1 and #2 isolated by two-hybrid screening. Vector, Yvh1, Yvh1C117S, Yvh1N and Yvh1C in the column headed by LexA denote plasmids that express LexA, LexA-Yvh1, LexA-Yvh1C117S, LexA-Yvh1N and LexAYvh1C protein, respectively.

although YPH1 was very recently reported to be an essential gene for cell cycle progression (10). Catalytic Domain of Yvh1p Interacts with Yph1p To examine whether wild-type Yvh1p interacts with these Yph1p fragments in the two-hybrid system, the full length of the wild-type YVH1 was fused to LexA of pBTM116a. L40 was transformed with pLexA-YVH1 and either clone #1 or #2. They grew on SCTrpLeuHis 5 mM AT plates and turned blue on X-gal plates as L40 harboring the LexA-Yvh1C117Sp mutant with clone #1 or #2 did (Fig. 2). Therefore, we concluded that wild-type Yvh1p, as well as mutant Yvh1C117S, interacts with Yph1p. To delimit the region of Yvh1p that interacts with Yph1p in the two-hybrid system, two baits that con-

tained the N-terminal catalytic phosphatase region corresponding to amino acids 1 to 205 (LexA-Yvh1N) or the C-terminal region with a novel zinc finger motif (26) corresponding to amino acids 206 to 364 (LexAYvh1C) were constructed. L40 was transformed with various combinations of these baits and preys. L40 harboring LexA-Yvh1N with either clone #1 or #2 grew on SC-TrpLeuHis 5 mM AT plates and turned blue on X-gal plates, the same as L40 harboring LexA-Yvh1 or LexA-Yvh1C117S, but L40 harboring LexA-Yvh1C with clone #1 or #2 did not. This result indicates that the catalytic domain of Yvh1p interacts with Yph1p. Yvh1p Interacts with the BRCT Domain of Yph1p Both YPH1 clone #1 and #2 contained the BRCT domain (Fig. 1A), which has been suggested to be a common element in many proteins involved in DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint and to be a domain for interaction between proteins (11). To determine whether Yvh1p interacts with the BRCT domain of Yph1p, preys containing various regions of Yph1p were constructed. Full-length (corresponding to amino acids 1 to 605), N-terminal domain (1 to 345), BRCT (346 to 459) or C-terminal region (460 to 605) of YPH1 was fused to GAD of pACT200. L40 was transformed with various combinations of baits and preys. L40 harboring GAD-BRCT with LexA-Yvh1, LexA-Yvh1C117S or LexAYvh1N grew on SC-TrpLeuHis 5 mM AT plates and turned blue on X-gal plates (Fig. 3). L40 harboring other combinations of baits and preys was negative in two-hybrid analysis. These results indicate that the BRCT domain of Yph1p is sufficient to interact with the catalytic domain of Yvh1p. It should be noted that the full-length Yph1p did not exhibit interaction with Yvh1p in the two-hybrid system, although the GADfused YPH1 was functionally expressed since it complemented the lethality of the yph1 disruptant (data not shown). Multicopy of YPH1 Suppresses Slow Growth of the yvh1 Disruptants The positive two-hybrid interaction of Yvh1p and Yph1p leads us to examine the genetic interactions between YVH1 and YPH1. We examined whether the multicopy of YPH1 suppresses slow growth of the yvh1 disruptant. Multicopy plasmids containing YPH1 (YEpU-YPH1) or YVH1 (YEpU-YVH1), and the pRS426 empty vector were introduced into the yvh1 disruptant YPA18H and the isogenic wild-type strain W303-1A. Ura transformants were streaked onto a SC-Ura plate and incubated at 30°C. While the yvh1 disruptant with pRS426 grew slowly, the yvh1 disruptant with YEpU-YPH1 grew normally as well as that with YEpU-YVH1 and the wild-type strain with pRS426 (Fig. 4A). This indicates that YPH1 is a multicopy suppressor of slow growth of the yvh1 dis-

FIG. 3. Identification of the Yph1p region required for its interaction with Yvh1p. (A) Schematic map of the Yph1p derivatives encoded in plasmids. Yph1p consists of 605 amino acids. Yph1N, Yph1BRCT and Yph1C correspond to amino acids 1 to 345, 346 to 459 and 460 to 605 of Yph1p, respectively. The BRCT domain is indicated by a black bar.

ruptant. To further investigate whether YPH1 on lowcopy plasmid suppresses slow growth of the yvh1 disruptant, low-copy plasmids containing YPH1 (YCpU-YPH1) or YVH1 (YCpU-YVH1) gene, and the pRS316 were introduced into the yvh1 disruptant YPA18H and the wild-type strain W303-1A. Ura transformants were streaked onto a SC-Ura plate and incubated at 30°C. The yvh1 disruptant either with YCpU-YPH1 or pRS316 showed slow growth relative to the wild-type strain with pRS316 and the yvh1 disruptant with YCpU-YVH1 (Fig. 4B). Therefore, the low-copy number of YPH1 did not suppress slow growth of the yvh1 disruptant. Multicopy of YPH1 Restores Transcription of IME2 in the yvh1 Disruptant Yvh1p is required for efficient sporulation in addition to vegetative growth (7). It has been reported that yvh1 disruption decreased the transcription of IME1 and IME2 that encode two critical regulatory factors controlling the transcription of sporulation-specific genes; an even greater effect was observed on IME2 (7). To examine whether multicopy of YPH1 suppresses the phenotype of

Cells of wild-type strain with pRS426 and the yvh1 disruptants with plasmid pRS426, YEpU-YVH1 or YEpU-YPH1 were pregrown to mid-log phase ( A660 1.0) in YPAc medium. The cells were then harvested, washed with sterile water, transferred to an equal volume of the sporulation medium, and incubated at 30°C for an additional 4 h. Total RNA was prepared from each of cell cultures at 0 h (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) and 4 h (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) after the shift to the sporulation medium. Equal amounts of RNA (5 g) were applied to lanes in agarose gel (1.5%) containing formaldehyde and separated by electrophoresis. The gel was blotted onto a nylon filter. Filters were first hybridized with a P-labeled IME2 DNA prepared by PCR as a probe and then rehybridized with a P-labeled ACT1 DNA prepared by PCR as a probe.

Multicopy plasmids containing YPH1 (YEpL-YPH1) or YVH1 (YEpL-YVH1), and pRS415 empty vector were introduced into the yph1 disruptant SH9239 and the wild-type strain W303-1A harboring the YCpU-YPH1 plasmid. Leu transformants were selected on SC-UraLeu plates and streaked onto 5-FOA and SC-UraLeu plates. Although all clones grew on SC-UraLeu plates, the wild-type strain and yph1 disruptant with YEpL-YPH1 grew on 5-FOA plates while the yph1 disruptants with YEpL-YVH1 or pRS415 never formed colonies on 5-FOA plates. This indicates that multicopy of YVH1 does not suppress the lethality of the yph1 disruptant (data not shown). We constructed the double disruptant of YVH1 and YPH1. The yvh1 disruptant YPB18H and the yph1 disruptant SH9239 harboring YCpU-YPH1 were crossed. The resultant heterozygous diploid was sporulated, dissected and the His Trp Ura double-disrupted segregants were selected. Similarly, the wild-type segregant (His Trp Ura ) and His Trp Ura and His Trp Ura single-gene-disrupted segregants were obtained. When these segregants were streaked onto 5-FOA and SC-Ura plates, all clones grew on SC-Ura plates. The wild-type and yvh1-disrupted cells grew on 5-FOA plates while the yph1-disrupted and yvh1-yph1-double-disrupted cells never formed colonies on 5-FOA plates (data not shown), indicating that the yvh1 disruption is hypostatic to the yph1 disruption. DISCUSSION To gain an insight into the roles of dual-specificity protein phosphatase Yvh1p associated with multiple cellular processes such as vegetative growth, sporulation and glycogen accumulation, we have searched for proteins that interact with Yvh1p including substrates and regulatory subunits. Using Yvh1p as a bait in the two-hybrid system, we isolated YPH1, a yeast pescadillo homolog (10). The catalytic domain of Yvh1p was found to interact with the BRCT domain of Yph1p. The slow growth and decreased IME2 expression in the sporulation of the yvh1 disruptant were suppressed by multicopy of YPH1. Our genetic data (Figs. 4 and 5) indicate that Yph1p is involved in sporulation as well as vegetative growth and suggest that Yph1p is situated downstream of Yvh1p in vegetative growth and sporulation. One form of cellular regulation implicated in both vegetative growth and sporulation is the cAMP-PKA signal transduction cascade (27). Yvh1p was suggested to modulate a component of the cAMP-PKA cascade (8) since the reducing cAMP levels by overexpression of PDE1 and PDE2 encoding the phosphodiesterases suppressed the phenotypes associated with sporulation and glycogen accumulation of the yvh1 disruptant. Yph1p may also participate in the cAMP-PKA cascade.

the yvh1 disruptant associated with sporulation, the transcription of IME2 was monitored following transfer of wild-type diploid cells carrying the empty vector pRS426 and homozygous yvh1 diploid cells carrying the plasmid pRS426, YEpU-YVH1 or YEpU-YPH1 to the sporulation medium. Cells of these strains were pregrown to exponential phase in YPAc and transferred to the sporulation medium. Total RNAs were prepared from cells at 0 h and 4 h after transfer to the sporulation medium and subjected to Northern blotting. In the wildtype cells with pRS426, a high level of IME2 transcription was observed at 4 h after transfer (Fig. 5). In contrast, the transcription level of IME2 did not increase after transfer in the homozygous yvh1 disruption cells with pRS426, consistent with the observation reported by Park et al. (7). When cells of the yvh1 disruptant with YEpU-YPH1 were transferred to the sporulation medium, the high level of IME2 transcription after transfer was restored in a manner similar to wild-type cells and the yvh1 disruptant with YEpU-YVH1. This result indicates that multicopy of YPH1 suppresses the decreased IME2 expression in the yvh1 disruptant. We also examined the transcription of IME1 in the yvh1 disruptant, but did not observe a decrease in the IME1 transcription (data not shown). As Park et al. mentioned that the effect of yvh1 disruption on the IME1 transcription was much smaller than that on IME2 (7), such a small effect might have been undetectable in our experiment. Multicopy and Disruption of YVH1 Do Not Suppress Cell Lethality of the yph1 Disruptants The disruption of YPH1 was reported to result in cell lethality (10). We then examined whether YVH1 on a

The two-hybrid interaction between Yvh1p and Yph1p suggests that Yph1p is a substrate or a regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase Yvh1p. In either case, it is possible to imagine the mechanism by which the multicopy of YPH1 suppresses the phenotypes of the yvh1 disruptant. It is assumed that the phosphorylation level of the substrate, whether it be Yph1p or any other protein, is increased in the yvh1 disruptant. If Yph1p is a substrate of Yvh1p, the multicopy of YPH1 may increase the level of nonphosphorylated form of Yph1p, thereby suppressing the phenotype of the yvh1 disruptant. On the other hand, if Yph1p is a regulatory subunit of Yvh1p, the ability of multicopy YPH1 to suppress phenotypes of the yvh1 disruptant may be due to increased binding and sequestering the phosphorylated substrate. Although either of these two possibilities is likely to operate, our finding that the interaction with Yph1p is made through the catalytic domain of Yvh1p (Fig. 2) supports the former possibility. If this is the case, it should be verified whether Yph1p is a phosphorylated protein. We noted that the noncatalytic region of Yvh1p contains the zinc-finger domain which is known for its role in mediating multiprotein complex assembly (5). Therefore, it is possible that the regulatory or targeting protein that interacts with the zinc-finger domain of Yvh1p may exist. Yph1p has the BRCT domain (Fig. 1A), which has been suggested to be a common element in many proteins involved in DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint and a domain for interaction between proteins (11). We revealed that Yvh1p interacts with Yph1p through the BRCT domain. Although the BRCT domain fragmented from Yph1p interacted with Yvh1p in the twohybrid system, the full length of Yph1p was inaccessible to Yvh1p. Protein-protein interaction is sometimes regulated by allosteric effects, such as modification or binding of other proteins. For example, calmodulin (CaM), when bound to Ca2 , changes its conformation largely and is able to bind to its targets such as CaMkinase (28). Therefore, we imagine that such a conformational change contributes to the interaction between Yvh1p and Yph1p. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Y.
