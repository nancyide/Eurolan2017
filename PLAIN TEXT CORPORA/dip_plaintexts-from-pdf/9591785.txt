The RHO1 gene encodes a homolog of mammalian RhoA small G protein in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have shown that Bni1p is one of the downstream targets of Rho1p and regulates reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton through the interaction with pro®lin, an actin monomer-binding protein. A Bni1p-binding protein was anity puri®ed from the yeast cytosol fraction and was identi®ed to be Tef1p/ Tef2p, translation elongation factor 1a (EF1a). EF1a is an essential component of the protein synthetic machinery and also possesses the actin ®lament (F-actin)binding and -bundling activities. EF1a bound to the 186 amino acids region of Bni1p, located between the FH1 domain, the proline-rich pro®lin-binding domain, and the FH2 domain, of which function is not known. The binding of Bni1p to EF1a inhibited its F-actin-binding and -bundling activities. The BNI1 gene deleted in the EF1a-binding region did not suppress the bni1 bnr1 mutation in which the actin organization was impaired. These results suggest that the Rho1p± Bni1p system regulates reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton through the interaction with both EF1a and pro®lin. Keywords: Rho; actin cytoskeleton; EF1a

Introduction The Rho family (Rho) belongs to the small G protein superfamily and consists of the Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 subfamilies (Hall, 1994; Takai et al., l995). Evidence is accumulating that, through reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, Rho regulates various cell functions, such as cell shape change, formation of stress ®bers and focal adhesions, cell motility, membrane ruing, cytokinesis, cell aggregation, cell-to-cell adhesion, and smooth muscle contraction (Hall, 1994; Takai et al., 1995). Rho has two interconvertible forms: GDPbound inactive and GTP-bound active forms. The GTP-bound form interacts with its speci®c downstream target and performs its cell functions. Many potential targets of Rho have been identi®ed, but it has not yet been clari®ed how Rho regulates reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton through these targets (Machesky and Hall, 1996). Cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae grow by budding for cell division and the actin cytoskeleton

plays a pivotal role in the budding and cytokinesis processes (Drubin, 1991). The budding yeast possesses the Rho gene family members, including RHO1, RHO2, RHO3, RHO4, and CDC42 (Cid et al., 1995). RHO1 is a homolog of the mammalian RhoA gene and the rho1 mutants are de®cient in the budding process (Yamochi et al., 1994). Immuno¯uorescence microscopic study indicates that Rho1p is localized at the growth site, including the presumptive budding site, the bud tip, and the cytokinesis site (Yamochi et al., 1994). These results suggest that Rho1p regulates the processes of bud formation through reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Concerning the downstream targets of Rho1p, at least three molecules have thus far been identi®ed: Pkc1p (Protein kinase C 1), which regulates the MAP kinase cascade (Nonaka et al., 1995; Kamada et al., 1996); 1,3-b-glucan synthase, which is involved in cell wall synthesis (DrgonovaÂ et al., 1996; Qadota et al., 1996); and Bni1p (Bud neck involved 1), which is involved in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (Kohno et al., 1996). Bni1p has also been shown to be a potential target of Cdc42p, Rho3p, and Rho4p (Evangelista et al., 1997; Imamura et al., unpublished results). BNI1 and its related genes in other organisms, including diaphanous (Castrillon and Wasserman, 1994) and cappuccino (Emmons et al., 1995) in Drosophila, FigA of Aspergillus (Marhoul and Adams, 1995), and fus1 of S. pombe (Petersen et al., 1995), have been shown to be involved in cytokinesis, the establishment of cell polarity, or normal cell morphology. These proteins share conserved domains named FH1 and FH2 (Formin Homology) (Castrillon and Wasserman, 1994). Very recently, the Rho-Bni1p system has been shown to be conserved in mammalian cells and regulate reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (Watanabe et al., 1997). It has moreover been shown that Bni1p and Bnr1p, the product of its related gene, BNR1 (BNI1 Related), regulate reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton by interacting with pro®lin, an actin monomer-binding protein, at their proline-rich FH1 domains (Evangelista et al., 1997; Imamura et al., 1997). Since pro®lin is implicated in polymerization of actin (Sohn and Goldschmidt-Clermont, 1994), the Rho1p ±Bni1p system is likely to be involved in the regulation of polymerization of actin. However, it remains to be clari®ed how the Rho1p ±Bni1p system regulates reorganization of ®lamentous actin (F-actin), another important process for reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. In this study, we attempted to isolate a Bni1pbinding protein and identi®ed it to be EF1a, known to be a component of eukaryotic protein synthetic

machinery. EF1a has been shown to possess various biochemical or biological activities, including the Factin-binding and -bundling activities (Demma et al., 1990; Yang et al., 1990), the microtuble-severing activity (Shiina et al., 1994), and the activity making ®broblasts highly susceptible to transformation (Tatsuka et al., 1992). EF1a has furthermore been shown to be colocalized with the actin cytoskeleton in mammalian (Edmonds et al., 1996) and amoebae (Dharmawardhane et al., 1991) cells. However, the physiological signi®cance of the interaction of EF1a with F-actin remained obscure. Our results suggest that EF1a is involved in the Rho1p± Bnilp-mediated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. 2012

Results Isolation of EF1a as a Bni1p-binding protein A Bni1p-binding protein was anity puri®ed from the yeast cytosol fraction using maltose-binding protein (MBP)-Bni1p(1229 ±1650), which contained the FH1 and FH2 domains, as a ligand. A protein with a Mr of about 47 kDa was detected as a major band (Figure 1). This protein was isolated in a large amount, peptides were generated by proteolytic digestion and amino acid sequences of two of these peptides were determined. The sequences perfectly matched with those of Tef1p/ Tef2p, which is EF1a (Schirmaier and Philippsen, 1984). Tef2p is a homolog of Tef1p with 100% amino acid sequence identity. The predicted Mr of Tef1p/ Tef2p (49.9 kDa) was consistent with the Mr of the Bni1p-binding protein. We concluded that the Bni1pbinding protein with a Mr of about 47 kDa was Tef1p/ Tef2p. Since EF1a had been shown to possess F-actinbinding and -bundling activities (Demma et al., 1990;

Yang et al., 1990), we further characterized these Bni1p-Tef1p/Tef2p interactions. For this purpose, we puri®ed the His10-tagged human EF1a (His10-EF1a) (Shiina et al., 1994), whose amino acid sequence is 81% identical and 97% homologous to that of yeast Tef1p/Tef2p. His10-EF1a bound to MBP±Bni1p(1229 ± 1650) as yeast Tef1p/Tef2p did (Figure 2A). The concentration of His10-EF1a, which gave a halfmaximal binding to MBP-Bni1p(1229 ±1650), was about 0.3 mM. The region of Bni1p which bound to His10-EF1a was delimited and it was found that the 186 amino acids region between the FH1 and FH2 domains bound to His10-EF1a (Figure 2B and C). Inhibition by Bni1p of the F-actin-binding and -bundling activities of EF1a We next examined the eect of Bni1p(1328 ±1513) on the F-actin-binding and -bundling activities of EF1a. The F-actin-binding activity was assayed by cosedimentation with F-actin by ultracentrifugation. The Factin-bundling activity was assayed by two methods:

results indicate that GST-Bni1p(1328±1513) inhibited the F-actin-binding activity of EF1a. We concluded that the binding of Bni1p to EF1a inhibited both the F-actin-binding and -bundling activities of EF1a. Formation of the Bni1p-EF1a-pro®lin ternary complex We have previously shown that pro®lin binds to the FH1 domain of Bni1p (Imamura et al., 1997). We examined whether EF1a, pro®lin, and Bni1p form a ternary complex. His10-EF1a bound to MBPBni1p(1229 ±1650) complexed with GST-pro®lin, but not to GST-pro®lin (Figure 4). This result indicates that EF1a, pro®lin, and Bni1p form a ternary complex. Requirement of the EF1a-binding region of Bni1p for the functions of Bni1p It should be examined genetically whether the interaction of Bni1p with Tef1p/Tef2p is of physiological signi®cance. TEF1/TEF2 have not yet been demonstrated genetically to be involved in the control of the actin cytoskeleton. However, this would be dicult to be demonstrated, because a major function of Tef1p/Tef2p is elongation of a peptide chain in translation (Schirmaier and Philippsen, 1984). Therefore, we examined the eect of deletion of the EF1abinding region of BNI1 on the functions of BNI1. Cells of the bni1 bnr1 double mutant show temperaturesensitive growth, abnormal morphology and abnormal distribution of cortical actin patches (Imamura et al., 1997). pRS316-GAL1-BNI1D(1328 ±1513), lacking the EF1a-binding region of BNI1, did not suppress the temperature-sensitive phenotype (Figure 5). This result suggests that the interaction of Bni1p with Tef1p/Tef2p is important for the functions of Bni1p. 2013

(1) viscometry of F-actin solution; and (2) sedimentation of F-actin by ultracentrifugation. His10-EF1a increased the viscosity of F-actin solution, but this activity was inhibited by glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Bni1p(1328± 1513) in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3A). The F-actin-bundling activity of a-actinin was not inhibited by GST-Bni1p(1328 ±1513) (data not shown). GST-Bni1p(1328 ±1513) by itself showed a negligible eect on the viscosity. In the presence of His10-EF1a, F-actin sedimented with His10-EF1a by ultracentrifugation at 20000 g, due to its F-actin bundling activity (Figure 3B, b). GST-Bni1p(1328± 1513), but not GST, inhibited this His10-EF1a-induced sedimentation of F-actin at 20 000 g (Figure 3B, c and d). These results indicate that GST-Bni1p(1328 ± 1513) inhibited the F-actin-bundling activity of EF1a. A fraction of His10-EF1a was recovered with GSTBni1p(1328 ±1513) in the 100 000 g supernatant (Figure 3B, c). Moreover, neither His10-EF1a nor GST-Bni1p(1328±1513) was detected in the 100 000 g precipitate, which contained most of the F-actin. These

A transformant obtained from each transformation was streaked onto a YPGalAU plate medium and incubated for 4 days at 338C

Discussion In the present and previous (Imamura et al., 1997) works, we have shown that Bni1p directly interacts with both pro®lin and EF1a. Bni1p interacts at its FH1 domain with pro®lin (Imamura et al., 1997), which is implicated in polymerization of actin (Sohn and Goldschmidt-Clermont, 1994). Pro®lin has been shown to stimulate the ADP/ATP exchange reaction of actin (Sohn and Goldschmidt-Clermont, 1994). However, the interaction of pro®lin with MBP-Bni1p(1229± 1650) did not show any eect on this activity (Umikawa et al., unpublished results). EF1a bound to the region just downstream of the FH1 domain of Bni1p, suggesting that EF1a is required for reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton regulated by the FH1 domain-pro®lin action. The formation of the ternary complex composed of Bni1p, pro®lin, and EF1a seems to be consistent with this possibility. Recently, a novel protein, Bud6p/Aip3p, has been shown to interact with the C-terminal region of Bni1p by the two-hybrid method (Evangelista et al., 1997). The bud6/aip3 mutant shows the phenotypes similar to those of the bni1 mutant (Zahner et al., 1996). Moreover, Bud6p/ Aip3p has been independently isolated by the twohybrid screening method as a protein which binds to actin (Amberg et al., 1997). Although biochemical characterization of Bud6p/Aip3p has not yet been reported, it is possible that Bud6p/Aip3p is an F-actinbinding protein. EF1a may also be involved in the bundling of the Bud6p/Aip3p-bound F-actin. It is currently not known how the Bni1p-EF1a interactions are regulated. It has been shown that overexpression of Bni1p lacking the N-terminal, Rho1p-binding region induces abnormal organization of the actin cytoskeleton (Evangelista et al., 1997). This result suggests that Rho1p is involved in the regulation of the Bni1p-mediated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. It is interesting to examine whether Rho1p regulates the interaction of Bni1p with pro®lin and/or EF1a. For this purpose, we have attempted to express and purify full-length Bni1p in yeast, insect, and mammalian cell systems. However, we have not yet succeeded in purifying it due to its insolubility and proteolytic degradation. Our genetic result suggests that the interaction of Bni1p with EF1a is important for the functions of Bni1p. EF1a has recently been isolated as a gene whose overexpression causes aberrant cell morphology in the ®ssion yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (D Hirata,

personal communication). This result genetically indicates that EF1a is involved in the cytoskeletal control in ®ssion yeast. It is possible that this phenotype is caused by perturbation of the function of a Bni1p-like protein in S. pombe. Another intriguing hypothesis for the physiological signi®cance of the Bni1p-EF1a interactions is that Bni1p localizes EF1a to regulate translation of speci®c mRNAs in speci®c areas of cells. In this respect, it should be noted that the bni1 mutation has been isolated as a mutation, she5, which is de®cient in daughter cellspeci®c localization of Ash1p (Jansen et al., 1996). Ash1p is a repressor of the HO gene, which is speci®cally transcribed in mother cells. Recently, the ASH1 mRNA has been shown to be speci®cally localized in daughter cells (Long et al., 1997). Therefore, it is possible that EF1a bound to Bni1p is responsible for the translation of the ASH1 mRNA in daughter cells. The localization of speci®c mRNAs has been shown to play an important role in generation of cell polarity (Bassell and Singer, 1997). The Rho1p-Bni1p system may regulate reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and/or translation of speci®c mRNAs by interacting with EF1a. Materials and methods Yeast and E. coli strains and growth conditions for yeast cells Yeast strains, BJ5457 (MATa ura3-52 leu2D1 trp1 his3D200 lys2-801 pep4::HIS3 prb1D1.6R can1) and HIY11 (MATa ura3 leu2 trp1 his3 ade2 bni1::HIS3 bnr1::URA3), were used for isolation and puri®cation of a Bni1p-binding protein and functional study of the bni1 mutant gene, respectively. An E. coli strain DH5a was used for construction and propagation of plasmids and purification of recombinant proteins. Yeast strains were grown in rich medium that contained 2% Bacto-peptone (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI), 1% Bacto-yeast extract (Difco), 0.04% adenine sulfate, and 0.02% uracil and 2% glucose (YPDAU) or 3% galactose and 0.2% sucrose (YPGalAU). Yeast transformations were performed by the lithium acetate methods (Gietz et al., 1992). Transformants were selected on SD medium that contained 2% glucose and 0.7% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco) and amino acids were supplemented to SD medium when required as described (Sherman et al., 1986). Isolation and puri®cation of a Bni1p-binding protein All manipulations were carried out at 0 ± 48C. Yeast cells of BJ5457 (30 g wet weight) were suspended in 60 ml of Buer A (20 mM Tris/HCl at pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 10 mg/ml of leupeptin, 20 mg/ml of aprotinin, 10 mM (p-amidinophenyl) methanesulfonyl fluoride and 1 mg/ml of pepstatin A). The cell suspension was homogenized with 30 ml of glass beads (0.45-mm diameter). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1700 g for 10 min and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 100 000 g for 1 h. The resulting supernatant (60 ml, 700 mg of protein) was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation. The 50 ± 80% precipitate was dissolved in 10 ml of Buer A and the sample was dialyzed against Buer A. One ml of the dialyzed sample was applied onto an amylose resin column which was prebound to 30 mg of MBP-Bni1p(1229 ± 1650). After the column was washed three times with 20 ml of Buer B (20 mM Tris/HCl at pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT), the bound proteins were eluted with 300 ml of Buer B containing 10 mM maltose. The eluted proteins were subjected to SDS ± PAGE, followed by protein staining with Coomassie brilliant blue.

(0.5 mM) was mixed with G-actin (0.3 mg/ml) in the presence of GST-Bni1p(1328 ± 1513) or GST (0 ± 1 mM) in 100 ml of a buer containing 20 mM Tris/HCl at pH 7.2, 56 mM piperazine-N,N'-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid)/NaOH at pH 6.8, 2.0 mM MgCl2, 1.0 mM EGTA, and 0.1 mM ATP, and the mixture was sucked into a 0.1-ml micropipette. After the incubation for 30 min at 258C, the time for a stainless steel ball to fall a ®xed distance in the pipette was measured. Assay for sedimentation of F-actin G-Actin was polymerized by incubation for 30 min at room temperature in a polymerization buer containing 20 mM imidazole/HCl at pH 7.0, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM ATP. Puri®ed recombinant His10-EF1a (1 mM) and/or Bni1p(1328 ± 1513) (1 mM) was mixed with F-actin (0.3 mg/ml) and incubated for 60 min at 48C in 300 ml of a buer containing 56 mM piperazine-N,N'-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid)/NaOH at pH 6.8, 6 mM imidazole/HCl at pH 7.0, 1.3 mM MgCl2, 0.7 mM EGTA, and 0.3 mM ATP. The mixture was then centrifuged at 20 000 g for 30 min at 48C. The supernatant (20 000 g supernatant) was removed, and the precipitate (20 000 g precipitate) was carefully washed with the same buer. The 20 000 g supernatant was then centrifuged at 100 000 g for 30 min at 48C. The 100 000 g supernatant and the solubilized samples of the 20 000 g and 100 000 g precipitates were subjected to SDS ± PAGE, followed by protein staining with Coomassie brilliant blue. Molecular biological techniques and construction of plasmids Standard molecular biological techniques were used for construction of plasmids, DNA sequencing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Sambrook et al., 1989). DNA sequences were determined using ALFred DNA sequencer (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) and PCRs were performed using GeneAmp PCR System 2400 (PerkinElmer, Norwalk, CT). Various DNA fragments encoding truncated Bnilps were generated by PCR and inserted into pGEX-4T-2-HA (Imamura et al., 1997) and pMAL-c2 (New England BioLabs, Inc.) for the expression of proteins fused to GST and MBP, respectively. pET16b-EF1a (Shiina et al., 1994) was used for the expression of His10-EF1a. pRS316GAL1-BNI1D(1328 ± 1513) was constructed as follows: a BNI1 DNA fragment deleted in the region from 3985 ± 4540 (codon 1328 to codon 1513) of the BNI1 open reading frame was generated by the PCR mutagenesis methods (Higuchi, 1989). This fragment was cloned into a yeast vector, pRS316-GAL1, to express the BNI1 deletion mutant gene under the control of the GAL1 promoter. Other procedures SDS ± PAGE was performed as described (Laemmli, 1970). Protein concentrations were determined as described with bovine serum albumin as a reference protein (Bradford, 1976).

Recombinant proteins used in this study were puri®ed from overexpressing E. coli. His10-EF1a was puri®ed as described (Shiina et al., 1994). Bni1p(1229 ± 1650) was puri®ed as a MBP fusion protein using an amylose resin column (New England BioLabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) as described (Guan et al., 1987). Human pro®lin (Imamura et al., 1997), Bni1p(1229 ± 1650), Bni1p(1229 ± 1513), Bni1p(1328 ± 1513), Bni1p(1229 ± 1328), and Bni1p(1416 ± 1953) were puri®ed as GST fusion proteins using a glutathione Sepharose 4B column (Pharmacia P-L Biochemicals Inc., Milwaukee, WI) as described (Kikuchi et al., 1992). The anti-poly-Lhistidine antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA. Assay for the binding of recombinant EF1a to recombinant Bni1ps Puri®ed His10-EF1a (500 pmol) in 500 ml of Buer B containing 150 mM NaCl was loaded onto an amylose resin column which was prebound to MBP or MBPBni1p(1229 ± 1650) (600 pmol) or a glutathione Sepharose 4B column which was prebound to GST, GST-Bni1p(1229 ± 1650), GST-Bni1p(1229 ± 1513), GST-Bni1p(1328 ± 1513), GST-Bni1p(1229 ± 1328), or GST-Bni1p(1426 ± 1953) (600 pmol). Each column was then washed with 20 column volumes of Buer B containing 150 mM NaCl. MBPBni1p(1239 ± 1650) or MBP was eluted with 300 ml of Buer B containing 10 mM maltose, whereas the GSTBni1p samples were eluted with 300 ml of Buer B containing 10 mM reduced glutathione. An aliquot (30 ml) of each eluate was subjected to SDS ± PAGE, followed by protein staining with Coomassie brilliant blue or Western blotting with the anti-poly-L-histidine antibody as described (Imamura et al., 1997) with the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL). Assay for the formation of the Bni1p-EF1a-pro®lin ternary complex Puri®ed His10-EF1a (500 pmol) in 500 ml of Buer B containing 150 mM NaCl was loaded onto a glutathione Sepharose 4B column which was prebound to GST-pro®lin (500 pmol) or the GST-pro®lin-MBP-Bni1p(1229 ± 1650) complex (100 pmol), which was prepared as described (Imamura et al., 1997). Each column was then washed with 20 column volumes of Buer B containing 150 mM NaCl. GST-Pro®lin was eluted with 300 ml of Buer B containing 10 mM reduced glutathione. An aliquot (50 ml) of each eluate was subjected to SDS ± PAGE, followed by protein staining with Coomassie brilliant blue. Low shear viscometry Low shear viscosity was measured as described (Pollard and Cooper, 1982; Kato et al., 1996). Brie¯y, His10-EF1a
