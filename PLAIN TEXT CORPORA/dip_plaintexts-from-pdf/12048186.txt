Control of Mitotic Exit in Budding Yeast

The elimination of mitotic kinase activity at the end of mitosis is essential for progression to the next stage of the eukaryotic cell cycle. In budding yeast, this process is controlled by a regulatory cascade called the mitotic exit network. Extensive genetic data indicate that mitotic exit network activity is determined by a GTP-binding protein, Tem1, and its putative regulators, Bub2, Bfa1, and Lte1. Here we describe the purification and in vitro activities of Tem1, Bub2, and Bfa1. We describe the nucleotide binding properties of Tem1 and characterize its intrinsic GTPase activity. The combination of Bfa1 and Bub2 acts as a two-component GTPase-activating protein for Tem1. In the absence of Bub2, Bfa1 inhibits the GTPase and GTP exchange activities of Tem1. This inhibition is elicited by either the N- or C-terminal regions of Bfa1, which also retain some ability to co-activate GTPase activity in the presence of Bub2. Although the C-terminal region of Bfa1 binds to Bub2, no interaction of the N-terminal half of Bfa1 with Bub2 was detected despite their combined GAP activity. Therefore, we propose that Bfa1 acts both as an adaptor to connect Bub2 and Tem1 and as an allosteric effector that facilitates this interaction.

In the final phases of eukaryotic cell division, the duplicated chromosomes and the centrosomes are partitioned between the dividing cells. Only then does the final step of cell separation occur, thus avoiding chromosomal loss or gain from precocious cell division or misaligned spindles. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this sequence of mitotic exit and cytokinesis is controlled by a signal transduction cascade called the mitotic exit network (MEN)1 (reviewed in Refs. 1 and 2). The primary role of the MEN is to reduce mitotic kinase activity, a prerequisite for spindle disassembly and cytokinesis. The MEN comprises a regulatory cascade with the small Ras-like protein, Tem1 (3), and its putative regulators, Bfa1, Bub2 and Lte1, at the top of the pathway (4­6). Other components are the kinases Cdc15, Cdc5, Dbf2, and Dbf20. Also involved are the Dbf2-associated protein Mob1, the phosphatase Cdc14, and

Nud1, a spindle pole body component important for proper localization of other MEN proteins (reviewed in Refs. 1 and 2). Recent data suggest that the functional sequence of the MEN components is Tem1-Cdc15-Mob1/Dbf2-Cdc14 (7). The role of the Cdc5 kinase is less clear, and it probably acts at different steps as a positive and/or negative regulator. When the MEN is activated, Cdc14 is released from the nucleolus and causes a reduction in mitotic kinase activity (8­10). Recently, the FEAR (Cdc14 early enaphase release) pathway has been described, which contributes to the initial release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus, but the precise role of FEAR remains unclear (11). Genetic evidence shows that Bfa1 and Bub2 act together as negative regulators of the MEN (12­15), whereas Lte1 can have a stimulatory effect (4, 16, 17). An interaction between at least some Bub2/Bfa1 and Tem1 occurs throughout mitosis and in G1 (6). Despite TEM1 being an essential gene, BUB2, BFA1, and LTE1 are dispensable in an unperturbed cell cycle. However, BUB2/BFA1 are essential for arresting the cell cycle following damage or misalignment of the mitotic spindle or after DNA damage (13, 18­20). Under these conditions, Bub2/ Bfa1 negatively regulate the cell cycle by delaying activation of MEN. Initially, Bub2/Bfa1 were envisaged as checkpoint activators, but more recent data indicate that Bub2/Bfa1 also function every cell cycle for the timely control of MEN activation (6). Tem1 and many components of the MEN bind to the spindle pole bodies and particularly to the spindle pole bodies destined for the daughter cell (16, 17, 21, 22). It has been proposed that during mitosis, the migration of the spindle pole bodies into the daughter cell, where Lte1 is primarily localized, triggers the activation of the MEN. MEN activation has also been related to the phosphorylation of Bfa1. Bfa1 is a substrate for Cdc5 and Cdc28 kinases, and its pattern of phosphorylation is determined by cell cycle phase and spindle status (6, 20). However, there is still controversy as to whether in vivo phosphorylation of Bfa1 by Cdc5 inhibits or stimulates its putative GAP activity (6, 20). Insights into Tem1 regulation by Bub2 and Bfa1 have arisen from comparisons with the related Schizosaccharomyces pombe septation initiation network (SIN), which controls septation and cytokinesis (reviewed in Refs. 1, 2). The homologues of most of the components of the MEN can be found in the SIN indicating that the two pathways are operationally similar. In the SIN, Spg1 is the homologue of Tem1. Both proteins belong to the Ras superfamily of small GTPases and share 58% sequence identity. In vivo, the down-regulation of Spg1 is achieved by Cdc16 and Byr4 (23, 24), which have been shown in vitro to act together as a two-component GTPase-activating protein (GAP) (25). Bub2 and Bfa1 are homologous to Cdc16 and Byr4 and, on this basis, have also been considered as a two-component GAP of Tem1. The activation of Tem1 is

thought to be carried out by Lte1, which contains a Cdc25 nucleotide exchange factor homology domain in its C terminus (4). Despite this similarity between the components of the MEN and SIN, TEM1 and BFA1 cannot complement spg1 or byr4 mutations, respectively (26, 27). Moreover, no positive regulator of the Spg1 GTP cycle has yet been identified. Despite the extensive genetic, cellular, and physiological data available concerning the roles of Bub2, Bfa1, and Lte1, no biochemical characterization of their in vitro activities has been carried out. Likewise, no data exist on the properties of Tem1 with the exception of its ability to bind GTP (3). Here, we characterize the enzymatic activity of Tem1 and show that Bfa1 and Bub2 act together as a two-component GAP. Furthermore, our data suggest that Bfa1 might induce a conformational change in Tem1 in addition to acting as the bridge between Tem1 and Bub2. MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmid Construction--The TEM1 open reading frame was amplified by PCR using a 5 -oligonucleotide containing a BamHI site and a 3 -oligonucleotide containing an HindIII site and was ligated into pMAL-c2X (New England Biolabs) yielding pMAL-Tem1. BFA1 was amplified by PCR using a 5 -oligonucleotide with a BamHI site and a 3 -oligonucleotide containing a XbaI site and was ligated into pGEX-KG yielding pGEX-Bfa1. pGEX-Bfa1 was then digested with BamHI and XhoI and a Bfa-containing fragment was cloned into pMAL-c2X digested with BamHI and SalI enzymes to obtain pMAL-Bfa1FL. The sequence encoding the 280 C-terminal residues 294­574 of Bfa1was amplified by PCR using a 5 -oligonucleotide containing a BamHI site and a 3 -oligonucleotide containing a XhoI site and was cloned into pMAL-c2X cut with BamHI and SalI enzymes to obtain pMAL-Bfa1CT. The sequence encoding the first 302 N-terminal residues of Bfa1 was amplified by PCR using a 5 -oligonucleotide with a BamHI site and a 3 -oligonucleotide containing an HindIII site and was cloned into pMAL-c2X to obtain pMAL-Bfa1NT. The BUB2 open reading frame was amplified by PCR using a 5 -oligonucleotide containing a SmaI site and a 3 -oligonucleotide containing a XbaI site and was ligated into pGEX-KG to give pGEX-Bub2. Protein Expression and Purification--Escherichia coli BL21 containing expression plasmids for MBP-Tem1, MBP-Bfa1 full-length, MBPBfa1CT, MBP-Bfa1NT, GST, and GST-Bub2 were grown in LB broth at 37 °C for 3 h, transferred to 25 °C, and after 1 h were induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl-1-thio- -D-galactopyranoside for 2 h. Cells expressing the MBP-Tem1 fusion protein were resuspended in cold lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 4 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM benzamidine, and 4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and passed through a French press. MBP-Tem1 fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography as recommended by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). The eluted protein was cut with Factor Xa (New England Biolabs) overnight at 4 °C, and Tem1 was separated from MBP by ion exchange chromatography on SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and stored at 80 °C. For Bfa1 and Bub2 fusion proteins, induced cells were lysed in cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, and 4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and purified using amylose resin (New England Biolabs) or glutathioneSepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After elution, GST-Bub2 was dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol and stored at 20 °C. MBP-Bfa1 fusion proteins were stored at 80 °C. Binding Assay--Glutathione beads with immobilized GST or GSTBub2 (4 g of each) were washed twice with binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, and 1 mM dithiothreitol), resuspended in 250 l of binding buffer plus 2% nonfat dry milk and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemical), and incubated with MBP-Bfa1 full-length, MBP-Bfa1CT, or MBP-Bfa1NT at a final concentration of 2 M for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with binding buffer plus 0.5% Nonidet P-40, resuspended in binding buffer plus 15 mM of reduced glutathione, and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-MBP antibodies (New England Biolabs). Nucleotide Exchange and GTPase Assays--1 g of purified Tem1 was incubated in 25 l of loading buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mM, NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.1 mM DTT) containing 0.1 MBq of [ -32P]GTP or 0.03 MBq of [ -35S]GTP for 10 min at 30 °C. For GDP exchange, we

used 5 g of purified Tem1 and 0.1 MBq of [3H]GDP. The mixture was

then put on ice, and 10 l were added to 50 l of reaction buffer (20 mM

Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mM GTP, and 0.6 g/ l BSA). The tube was transferred

at 30 °C, and at the indicated times, 10 l of the reaction was diluted in 990 l of cold washing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, and 5 mM MgCl2). The samples were filtered through prewetted nitrocellulose filters, washed three times with 4 ml of cold of washing buffer and air-dried. The amount of filter-bound radioactive nucleotide was determined by scintillation counting. When Bfa1 activity was examined, the indicated amount of purified Bfa1 was added to the loading buffer. When Bub2 activity was assessed, the indicated amount of purified Bub2 was added to the reaction buffer. The GDP and GTP dissociation rates, kd and kt, were calculated by a fit of the experimental data to a single exponential decay. Data points represent the average of at least two assays, which typically differed by 10%. However, we have noticed that there was a certain degree of quantitative variation from experiment to experiment because of GTPase instability on filters. A similar phenomenon has been previously reported for Sec4 and Ran (28, 29). RESULTS Protein Expression and Purification--To examine the properties of Tem1 and its putative regulators, Bfa1 and Bub2, all three proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography. Tem1 was expressed as an MBP-fusion protein, which was soluble in E. coli extracts. Following the removal of the affinity tag by Factor Xa, Tem1 was purified on SP-Sepharose to 95% homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). Bub2, Bfa1, and the fragments thereof were expressed as GST and MBP fusion proteins, respectively, and were used without further removal of the affinity tag. Fulllength Bfa1 and the N-terminal fragment migrate more slowly in SDS-PAGE than predicted by their calculated molecular weights. GST-Bub2 co-purified with a 60-kDa protein, which is likely to be the chaperone GroEL that has previously been reported to co-purify with Cdc16 (25). The induction of GSTBub2 expression at 14 °C overnight did not reduce the apparent ratio between the chaperone and Bub2 but significantly increased its activity. Nucleotide Dissociation and Hydrolysis--To characterize the GTPase activity of Tem1, the rates of GTP hydrolysis and nucleotide dissociation were determined in a filter binding

FIG. 2. Nucleotide dissociation and GTP hydrolysis of Tem1. Tem1-[ -32P]GTP (q) and Tem1-[ -35S]GTP (f) were incubated at 30 °C, and Tem1-[3H]GDP (OE) was incubated at 13 °C. At the indicated times, samples were taken, and the amount of radioactive nucleotide remaining bound to Tem1 was determined by a filter binding assay. The results are expressed as a percentage of the initial amount of radioactivity. Data were fitted to a monoexponential decay. assay. Radiolabeled nucleotides were bound to Tem1. After 10 min, an excess of non-radioactive nucleotide was added, and a loss of radioactivity was measured over 30 min. With Tem1-[ of GTP at a rate, kd, and 2) by hydrolysis and subsequent release of [ -32P] at a rate, khyd. Therefore, the kinetics of loss of counts from Tem1-[ -32P]GTP are the sum of kd and khyd and mine the rate of GTP dissociation alone, the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue [ -35S]GTP was used. In this case, [ -35S]GTP dissociation of GDP was assayed using Tem1 loaded with [3H]GDP. Initial attempts to determine the rate for GDP dissociation at 30 °C proved difficult, because almost all of the [3H]GDP bound to Tem1 was lost within the first sampling interval. Carrying out the reaction at the lower temperature of high rate of intrinsic GDP release may explain why the putative guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Lte1, is not an essential protein at least at 30 °C. Even without Lte1, there might be sufficient intrinsic exchange activity to provide enough Tem1GTP for MEN activation. Effect of Bfa1 on Tem1 Activity--Byr4, the S. pombe homologue of Bfa1, inhibits both GTP dissociation and GTP hydrolysis by Spg1 (25). To test whether Bfa1 might have similar properties, we monitored the intrinsic GTPase activity of Tem1 and nucleotide dissociation in the presence of varying amounts of Bfa1. For this test, Tem1 was loaded with radioactive nucleotides and incubated for times and temperatures that gave an 50% loss of label as shown in Fig. 2. The effect of Bfa1 on GTP dissociation was assayed using Tem1 loaded with [ -35S]GTP. Whereas 45% of radiolabel was released during the subsequent incubation period in the absence of Bfa1, this release was progressively inhibited by increasing amounts of Bfa1. Thus, Bfa1 inhibits GTP dissociation from Tem1. Likewise, the effect of Bfa1 on GTP hydrolysis was monitored with Tem1 loaded with [ -32P]GTP. Again, there was a strong Bfa1-dependent inhibition of loss of radioactivity from Tem1-[ -32P]GTP indicating the inhibition of GTP hydrolysis by Bfa1 (Fig. 3). Dissociation and hydrolysis of GTP were fully inhibited at concentrations of 200 nM Bfa1, suggesting that the affinity between

After the addition of excess cold nucleotide, radioactive label bound to Tem1 was assayed by filter binding at time 0 and after 5 min ([ -32P]GTP ( ) and [3H]GDP (q)) or 10 min ([ -35S]GTP ( )). Incubation was at 30 °C for [ -32P]GTP and [ -35S]GTP or at 13 °C for [3H]GDP. The data represent the percentage of the radioactivity remaining after incubation.

Tem1 and Bfa1 is high with a dissociation constant in the low nanomolar range. In contrast, Bfa1 does not markedly affect the dissociation of GDP from Tem1 as judged by the similar losses of radiolabeled [3H]GDP in the presence or absence of Bfa1 (Fig. 3) Bub2 and Bfa1 Act Together as a Two-component GAP for Tem1--Although Bub2 and Cdc16 contain a TBC homology domain (domain in Tre-2, BUB2p, and Cdc16p) typical of GAPs for Rab-like GTPases (30), the Bub2 homologue, Cdc16, only displays GAP activity in combination with Byr4 (25). To test whether Bub2 might have a similar activity, Tem1 was loaded with [ -32P]GTP in the presence or absence of Bfa1. After loading, increasing amounts of Bub2 were added, and the fraction of [ -32P]GTP remaining bound to Tem1 after a 7-min incubation at 30 °C was compared with levels bound at time zero (Fig. 4A). In the absence of Bfa1 or Bub2, 50% of the radioactive [ -32P]GTP bound to Tem1 was lost. This reflects the intrinsic GTP dissociation and GTPase activities of Tem1 as described above (Fig. 2). Notably, in the absence of Bfa1, there were no further changes in bound [ -32P]GTP upon the addition of increasing amounts of Bub2, clearly indicating that Bub2 alone does not affect either hydrolysis or dissociation of GTP from Tem1. In parallel assays increasing amounts of Bub2 were added to Tem1-[ -32P]GTP in the presence of a fixed concentration of Bfa1. In the zero Bub2 control, there was no loss of [ -32P]GTP from Tem1, a result already seen above in which Bfa1 alone inhibits the GTP hydrolysis and GTP dissociation (Fig. 3). However, the addition of Bub2 in the presence of Bfa1 caused a precipitous loss of radioactivity from Tem1-[ attributed to GTP hydrolysis and not because of an increased rate of GTP dissociation, we performed a similar assay with [ -35S]GTP (Fig. 4B). The addition of Bub2 caused no loss of the non-hydrolyzable [ -35S]GTP from Tem1 with or without accompanying Bfa1. The amount of Bub2 required to achieve

FIG. 5. Inhibition of GTP hydrolysis of Tem1 by N- and Cterminal regions of Bfa1. Tem1 was loaded with [ -32P]GTP in the presence of increasing amounts of full-length Bfa1 (q), Bfa1NT ( ), or Bfa1CT ( ). After the addition of excess cold nucleotide, samples were incubated at 30 °C for 5 min, and the amount of radiolabel bound to Tem1 was assayed by filter binding. The data represent the percentage of the radioactivity remaining after incubation. maximal stimulation of GAP activity is significantly higher than the amount of Bfa1 required for complete inhibition of GTP hydrolysis and dissociation (Fig. 4A). At present, we are not able to conclude whether this reflects a real difference in the affinities between these complexes or whether only a fraction of the Bub2 used in these assays is fully active, possibly because of the association with GroEL. The GAP-activated GTPase activity of Tem1 in the presence of 150 nM Bfa1 and 15 GTPase activity. Under these conditions, hydrolysis is complete after 5 min. As expected from Fig. 3, the presence of 150 nM Bfa1 alone caused a large reduction in the kinetics of GTP hydrolysis by Tem1. Activities of N- and C-terminal Regions of Bfa1--The results presented thus far show that Bfa1 has different activities depending upon the absence or presence of Bub2. Without Bub2, Bfa1 inhibits GTP hydrolysis and GTP dissociation from Tem, whereas it acts as a two-component GAP in the presence of Bub2. To characterize these different effects of Bfa1 in more detail and to map the regions that are responsible for these activities, we produced an N-terminal fragment of Bfa1, Bfa1NT encompassing residues 1­302 and a C-terminal fragment Bfa1CT encompassing residues 294­574. These fragments were expressed as MBP fusion proteins and purified from E. coli (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). Both fragments were tested for their effect on GTP dissociation and GTPase hydrolysis of Tem1. For this test, increasing amounts of Bfa1NT, Bfa1CT, and full-length Bfa1 were added to Tem1 during loading with [ -32P]GTP and the time course of loss of radioactivity was measured (Fig. 5). In the absence of Bfa1, only 50% [ -32P] GTP remained bound to Tem1 after 5 min because of GTP dissociation and GTP hydrolysis (see Fig. 2). Also, as expected from Fig. 3, 200 nM full-length Bfa1 prevented all loss of [ -32P]GTP. As shown in Fig. 5, both Bfa1NT and Bfa1CT inhibit GTP hydrolysis by Tem1. Bfa1CT shows similar concentration dependence as the full-length protein, indicating that both proteins bind Tem1 with equal affinities. In contrast,

The reactions were incubated for 7 min at 30 °C, and the fraction of radioactive label remaining bound to Tem1 was assayed by filter binding. The data represent the fraction of radioactivity remaining after incubation. B, Bub2 does not affect GTP exchange from Tem1. Tem1-[ -35S]GTP was incubated in the presence of 150 nM full-length Bfa1 for 10 min at 30 °C with or without 120 M Bub2, and the filter-bound radioactivity was determined. The data represent the percentage of the radioactivity remaining after incubation. C, GAP activity of Bfa1/Bub2. 240 nM Tem1 were incubated without Bfa1 and Bub2 (q), in the presence of 150 nM Bfa1 ( ), and in the presence of 150 nM Bfa1 and 15 M Bub2 ( ), and the time course of GTP hydrolysis was followed in filter binding assays.

slightly higher concentrations of Bfa1NT are required to achieve a similar effect. We have also observed that GSTBfa1NT and GST-Bfa1CT have the same inhibitory effects on GTP hydrolysis and exchange in Tem1 as do the equivalent MBP fusions (data not shown). Thus, the MBP moiety does not inhibit Tem1 activity, nor does the type of tag modify the activity of the Bfa1 fusion proteins. Next we investigated whether both of these two fragments can interact with Bub2 to form a two-component GAP for Tem1. The concentration dependence of Bub2 on GAP activity with full-length Bfa1 (150 nM) is shown in Fig. 6. More than Bub2. Bfa1CT is also capable of stimulating GTP hydrolysis, although 3­4 times higher amounts of Bub2 are required to achieve maximal activity. The Bfa1NT was also able to increase GTP hydrolysis in combination with Bub2, yet this fragment showed a significantly lower activity than the C-terminal part of the protein. Thus, the N-terminal as well as the Cterminal fragments of Bfa1 can act as a two-component GAP with Bub2, although there is a significant difference in their activity at identical Bub2 concentrations. In Vitro Interaction between Bfa1 and Bub2--To investigate whether the differences in GAP activity between the N- and C-terminal portions of Bfa1 are caused by their different affinities for Bub2, we carried out in vitro pull-down binding assays. GST-Bub2 or a GST control were bound to glutathione-sepharose beads and assayed for their ability to bind to Bfa1NT, Bfa1CT, or full-length Bfa1 (Fig. 7). Approximately, equal amounts of each form of Bfa1 were used as judged by Western blotting with an anti-MBP antibody. Only full-length Bfa1 and Bfa1CT bound to the GST-Bub2 beads. Indeed, the Bfa1CT seemed to bind more effectively to Bub2 than the full-length protein. No binding was detected with Bfa1NT, indicating both that this portion of Bfa1 does not interact with Bub2, and more generally, that binding is not caused by the MBP moiety of any

FIG. 7. In vitro interaction between Bfa1 and Bub2. Glutathione beads bound to GST alone or GST-Bub2 were incubated with MBP-Bfa1 full-length (FL), Bfa1CT (CT), or Bfa1NT (NT). After washing, proteins were eluted, blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with an anti-MBP antibody (New England Biolabs). Input protein (In) is shown. MW, molecular mass markers in descending order of size were 220, 97, 66, and 45 kDa. of the Bfa1 fusion proteins used in these assays. No form of Bfa1 bound to the control GST-only beads. The minor high molecular weight bands retained by GST-Bub2 and MBPBfa1CT are probably unspecific bands attributed to the milk used in the binding assay. To avoid the possibility that immobilizing Bub2 on beads may in some way interfere with the interaction with Bfa1NT, a second series of binding assays were performed with immobilized Bfa1 and free Bub2. MBP, MBP-Bfa1NT, MBP-Bfa1CT, and MBP-Bfa1FL were immobilized on amylose resin and assayed for binding in vitro transcribed and translated [35S]Bub2 (data not shown). These experiments confirmed that only full-length Bfa1 and Bfa1CT interact specifically with Bub2. DISCUSSION The activation of the mitotic exit network by Tem1 and its regulation by Bub2/Bfa1 has been the subject of intense analysis for several years. Here, we describe the purification and enzymatic activities of Tem1, Bub2, and Bfa1. We show that Tem1 is a GTPase, which is down-regulated by a two-component GAP comprising Bub2 and Bfa1. The negative regulation of mitotic exit by Bub2/Bfa1 in vivo can therefore be attributed to their ability to activate GTP hydrolysis and thereby reduce the active form of Tem1 until the spindle is correctly assembled and positioned for the even partitioning of chromosomes. The rates of GTP dissociation and GTP hydrolysis of Tem1 are very similar to those determined for its S. pombe homologue Spg1 and those of members of the Rho family of small GTPases (25, 31­33). As bfa1 and bub2 mutants are viable and grow at normal rates, the intrinsic GTPase activity of Tem1 may be sufficient for the correct execution of mitotic exit, at least in the absence of spindle damage. In contrast to GTP dissociation, the release of GDP from Tem1 and Spg1 is significantly faster than for many other small GTPases. The only other example of a GTPase with a comparatively high GDP off-rate is Sec4, which belongs to the Rab family of small GTPases (28). From the crystal structure of this protein, it has been suggested that differences in the switch regions might weaken Mg2 binding and thereby cause the high GDP off-rate (34). Similar structural features may be the reason for the high rate of GDP dissociation observed for Tem1 and Spg1. However, the confirmation of this notion or otherwise awaits the

structural characterization of Tem1 and Spg1. Nevertheless, the high GDP exchange rate is consistent with the observation that Lte1, the putative exchange factor for Tem1, is not essential at least at 30 °C (4). Presumably, in lte1 mutants, the high intrinsic exchange activity can maintain adequate levels of Tem1-GTP for mitotic exit. Bub2 contains a TBC domain that is the signature motif for GAPs specific for Rab-like small GTPases (30). GAPs for small GTPases are typically monomeric proteins that are able to increase the intrinsic GTPase rate by several orders of magnitude by a mechanism that often involves the stabilization of the switch regions of the GTPase and the supply of a catalytic residue into the active site of the GTPase (reviewed in Refs. 35 and 36). Yet, despite the presence of a GAP homology domain, Bub2 has an absolute requirement for Bfa1 as a co-activator of GAP activity. The only other system identified so far in which two proteins are required to form a functional GAP is the SIN, which is regulated by the small GTPase, Spg1, and its twocomponent GAP, Cdc16/Byr4 (25). In vitro results from the two systems suggest two roles for Bfa1 and Byr4 in bringing about co-activation. Firstly, the results presented here and by Furge et al. (25) suggest that Bfa1 and Byr4 have a "bridging" role in the GTPase GAP complex. Byr4 can interact with both Spg1 and Cdc16, but Spg1 and Cdc16 do not stably interact without Byr4. Similarly, we show that Bfa1 interacts with both Tem1 and Bub2. Bfa1 contacts Bub2 via its C-terminal region whereas both the N- and C-terminal portions of Bfa1 can contact Tem1 as judged by the inhibition of GTPase and GTP dissociation. A similar distribution of the binding regions was found in Byr4 (37). In GAP assays, it was largely the Bfa1 C-terminal region with its ability to interact with both Bub2 and Tem1 that supported GAP activity. Thus, Bfa1 like Byr4 might serve as an adaptor to connect Bub2 and Tem1. However, several observations suggest that Bfa1 might have an additional function. Bfa1 is subject to cell cycle and spindle damage-dependent fluctuations in phosphorylation that have been related to alterations in GAP activity (6, 20). Furthermore, Bfa1 and its N- or C-terminal fragments are able to inhibit GTP hydrolysis and GTP dissociation of Tem1. This activity is reminiscent of guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors and certain downstream effectors, which have previously been shown to inhibit GTP hydrolysis and/or nucleotide dissociation (38­41). In addition, the N-terminal fragment of Bfa1, which is unable to bind Bub2, is still able to act as a GAP in combination with Bub2, albeit at higher concentrations. Thus, the binding of Bfa1NT might be capable of inducing a conformational change in Tem1, which results in the formation of a binding site for Bub2. This suggestion is further supported by the reduced activity of the C-terminal portion of Bfa1 in promoting GAP activity compared with full-length Bfa1 (Fig. 6) despite the apparent higher affinity of Bfa1CT for Bub2 (Fig. 7). Together, these observations point to the C-terminal portion of Bfa1 acting as an adaptor to connect Bub2 and Tem1, whereas the N-terminal portion may modify the conformation of Tem1, thereby creating a binding site for Bub2. An example for the latter activity has been shown for Ran whose GTPase activity is enhanced by a combination of RanGAP and RanBP1 (29). Although RanBP1 is not absolutely required for RanGAP activity, its presence increases the rate of GTP hydrolysis by an order of magnitude (29). The structure of a trimeric complex between Ran, RanBP1, and RanGAP shows that there is no direct contact between RanGAP and RanBP1, making it unlikely that RanBP1 has a direct structural effect on RanGAP (42). Instead, it appears that RanBP1 relieves a conformation of Ran, which is inhibitory to RanGAP binding. Given the role of Bfa1 in acting with Bub2 to reduce Tem1-

GTP levels, it is paradoxical that Bfa1 acting without Bub2 maintains levels of Tem1-GTP. From this result, it might naively be predicted that the overexpression of Bfa1 would activate the MEN. However, the opposite occurs, and Bfa1 overexpression causes an anaphase arrest (15), likewise the overexpression of Byr4 inhibits septation in S. pombe (23). This lethal Byr4/Bfa1 overexpression phenotype can be suppressed by co-overexpression of Spg1/Tem1 (25).2 Thus, a high ratio of Bfa1 to Tem1 could inhibit the ability of Tem1-GTP to communicate with its effectors by competing for a common binding site on Tem1. As Tem1 requires a two-component GAP to restrain its activity, the ability of Bfa1 alone to block the activity of GTP-bound Tem1 therefore may provide a second tier of restraint to protect against precocious MEN activation. Although an interaction between Bub2 and Bfa1 has been seen throughout mitosis (6), it is unclear whether all or just a proportion of Bfa1 and Bub2 are combined in this way. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of Bfa1 on Tem1 may safeguard against times when GAP activity is reduced by Bfa1 and Bub2 dissociation or by transiently low levels of Bub2. In summary, we present the first demonstration of the in vitro activities of Tem1 and their regulation by a GAP activity provided by a complex between Bub2 and Bfa1. Why such a complicated two-component GAP mechanism has evolved when most other small GTPases rely on monomeric GAPs remains an enigma. As a first step to answering this question, we present insights into the nature of Bub2 and Bfa1 interactions with each other and with Tem1. This work therefore provides the foundations for future investigations of how Bub2 and Bfa1 function as "gatekeepers" of the mitotic exit network.
