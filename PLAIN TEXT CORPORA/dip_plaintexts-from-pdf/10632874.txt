Summary Regulation of arginine metabolism requires the integrity of four regulatory proteins, ArgRI, ArgRII, ArgRIII and Mcm1. To characterize further the interactions between the different proteins, we used the twohybrid system, which showed that ArgRI and Mcm1 interact together, and with ArgRII and ArgRIII, without an arginine requirement. To de®ne the interacting domains of ArgRI and Mcm1 with ArgRIII, we fused portions of ArgRI and Mcm1 to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 (GBD) and created mutations in GBD-ArgRI and GBD-Mcm1. The putative a helix present in the MADS-box domain of ArgRI and Mcm1 is their major region of interaction with ArgRIII. Interactions between the two MADS-box proteins and ArgRIII were con®rmed using af®nity chromatography. The requirement for ArgRIII in the control of arginine metabolism can be bypassed in vitro as well as in vivo by overproducing ArgRI or Mcm1, which indicates that ArgRIII is not present in the protein complex formed with the `arginine boxes'. We show that the impairment of arginine regulation in an argRIII deletant strain is a result of a lack of stability of ArgRI and Mcm1. A mutation in ArgRI, impairing its interaction with ArgRIII, leads to an unstable ArgRI protein in a wild-type strain. ArgRIII integrity is crucial for Mcm1 function, as shown by the marked decreased expression of ®ve genes controlled by Mcm1. However, ArgRIII is likely to recruit other proteins in the yeast cell, as overexpression of Mcm1 does not compensate some physiological defects observed in an argRIII deletant strain.

Introduction Four proteins ArgRI (Arg80), ArgRII (Arg81), ArgRIII (Arg82) and Mcm1 regulate the expression of several genes involved in the metabolism of arginine in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the presence of arginine, they repress the synthesis of ®ve anabolic enzymes and induce the synthesis of two catabolic enzymes. Mutations in any of these genes impair the regulation by arginine (BeÂchet et al., 1970; Messenguy and Dubois, 1993). ArgRI and ArgRII are speci®c regulators, whereas ArgRIII and Mcm1 are global regulators. Mutations in Mcm1 also affect minichromosome maintenance, expression of haploid cell type-speci®c genes and G1 or G2 cell cycleregulated genes (Passemore et al., 1988; Jarvis et al., 1989; Althoefer et al., 1995; Oehlen et al., 1996; McInerny et al., 1997). The group of Grayhack has identi®ed the targets of Mcm1 in genes encoding proteins involved in cell wall and membrane integrity, cellular metabolism and stress tolerance (Kuo and Grayhack, 1994; Kuo et al., 1997). The ARGRIII gene encodes a protein involved in controlling several cellular processes, such as mating, sporulation and growth at 378C (Qiu et al., 1990; Dubois and Messenguy, 1994). The ArgRI and Mcm1 proteins belong to the MADS-box family of eukaryotic transcription factors, including human SRF (Serum Response Factor) and plant AG (Agamous) and DEFA (De®ciens) and two other yeast genes RML1 and SMP1 (for a review see Shore and Sharrocks, 1995; Dodou and Treisman, 1997; Watanabe et al., 1997). The MADS-box consists of a region of about 60 amino acids showing extensive sequence homology with more than 30 regulatory proteins. The N-terminal region of the MADS-box, which is predominantly hydrophilic with a high proportion of basic residues, is the major determinant of DNA-binding speci®city through an a helical structure, and the C-terminal region, containing numerous hydrophobic residues, is necessary for dimerization. Both N- and C-terminal regions are also implicated in mediating protein±protein interactions (Pellegrini et al., 1995). The region of similarity between ArgRI, Mcm1 and SRF, which is suf®cient to ensure their respective functions, spans 80 amino acids and is called `extended MADS-box' (Qiu et al., 1990; Mueller and Nordheim, 1991; Bruhn et al., 1992). In vitro, the ArgR-Mcm1 proteins interact, in the

presence of arginine, with sequences called `arginine boxes' located in the promoters of the genes co-regulated by arginine (Messenguy et al., 1991; Dubois and Messenguy, 1997). Using antibodies in gel shift assays, we have demonstrated that ArgRI and Mcm1 are parts of the DNA±protein complex containing the `arginine boxes' (Dubois and Messenguy, 1991). ArgRII is also a component of the complex, because overexpression of ArgRII enhances the formation of a DNA±protein complex in vitro and also because one deletion created in the ArgRII protein leads to a faster migrating complex (Qiu et al., 1991). Although the integrity of ArgRIII is required, we have no direct proof of its interaction with the other regulatory proteins involved in regulation by arginine. It is noteworthy that overexpression of ArgRI or Mcm1, but not ArgRII, partially bypasses an argRIII mutation in vivo (Bercy et al., 1987; Qiu et al., 1990). To understand the role of ArgRIII in the formation of a complex between ArgRI, ArgRII, Mcm1 and the `arginine boxes', we have determined using the two-hybrid system (Fields and Song, 1989) whether ArgRIII interacts with the different components of the regulatory complex in vivo. We report that the two MADS-box proteins, Mcm1 and ArgRI, interact together and with ArgRII and ArgRIII, but there is no association between ArgRII and ArgRIII. This technique has also enabled the de®nition of regions of ArgRI and Mcm1 that are required for their interaction with ArgRIII. We demonstrate that the interaction of ArgRIII with ArgRI and Mcm1 leads to a stabilization of these two proteins. All these data allow determination of the sequence of events required to regulate the expression of genes co-regulated by arginine. Moreover, we demonstrate that ArgRIII is crucial for Mcm1 function, although ArgRIII is likely to interact with other proteins.

Results Identi®cation of interactions between the different components of the ArgR-Mcm1 protein complex The two-hybrid system has been used successfully to

demonstrate interactions between proteins, even in systems as complicated as the RNA polymerase III multiprotein complex (Werner et al., 1993). Here, we have used the Gal4-based two-hybrid system to investigate interactions among the four regulatory proteins that control the metabolism of arginine. Two sets of plasmids, carrying the genes encoding ArgRI (Dubois et al., 1987), ArgRII (Messenguy et al., 1986), ArgRIII (Dubois et al., 1987) or Mcm1 (Passemore et al., 1988) proteins either fused to the transcription activation domain (GAD) or DNA-binding domain (GBD) of Gal4, were constructed. In all cases, the fusion proteins were expressed from an ADH1 promoter on a multicopy plasmid. The fusion proteins GBD-ArgRI, GAD-ArgRI, GBD-ArgRII, GAD-ArgRII, GBD-ArgRIII and GAD-ArgRIII are expressed and active because they are able (i) to restore normal growth of the corresponding deletant strains on a medium containing ornithine as the sole nitrogen source, and (ii) to restore repression of anabolic genes and induction of catabolic genes by arginine at a level similar to that of a wild-type strain (data not shown). GBD-Mcm1 and GAD-Mcm1 proteins partially suppress the phenotype of an argRIII deletant as well as wild-type Mcm1, but are not capable of ensuring the viability of a mcm1 deletant strain (data not shown). These plasmids were introduced in all pairwise combinations into yeast strain HY, containing LacZ and HIS3 alleles with UASGAL in their promoters. The results shown in Table 1 indicate that GBD-Mcm1 has a weak activation capacity and that GBD-ArgRII activates transcription of a lacZ reporter gene, in agreement with the result obtained with a LexA±ArgRII hybrid (Qiu et al., 1991). ArgRI and Mcm1 interact strongly with ArgRII. GBD-Mcm1 also shows a strong interaction with GAD-ArgRIII, whereas GAD-ArgRI shows the highest interaction with GBD-ArgRIII. The reverse combinations lead to a signi®cant b-galactosidase synthesis as it is higher than the one obtained in the strains transformed with the control GAD-Lys14 fusion protein (gift from M. El Alami), Lys14 being the transcriptional activator of lysine co-regulated genes (Feller et al., 1994). ArgRI and Mcm1 interact only weakly, and no interaction was detected

between ArgRII and ArgRIII. All these interactions were con®rmed by a growth test on a medium containing Xgal and a medium without histidine and with 3-aminotriazole (3-AT, 20 mM). The production of the blue colour in the presence of Xgal and the growth rate on a medium with 3-AT were in agreement with the levels of b-galactosidase measured in the different transformed strains. It is noteworthy that none of these interactions require the presence of arginine in the growth medium (data not shown). In order to test whether the interactions between the different proteins require the presence of one of the other components of the ArgR-Mcm1 system, we deleted the ARGRI, ARGRII and ARGRIII genes in the HY recipient strain (see Experimental procedures). The MCM1 gene was not deleted as it is essential for cell viability. The results presented in Fig. 1 indicate that the interaction between ArgRIII and Mcm1 does not require ArgRI or ArgRII (Fig. 1A), and the interactions between Mcm1 and ArgRII, or Mcm1 and ArgRI, do not require ArgRI or ArgRII respectively (Fig. 1B and C). Moreover, the interaction between ArgRI and ArgRIII occurs in the absence of ArgRII (Fig. 1D). The deletion of ARGRIII strongly affects the interactions when Mcm1 is one of the partners (Fig. 1B and C) and also reduces the interaction between Q 2000 Blackwell Science Ltd, Molecular Microbiology, 35, 15±31

ArgRI and ArgRII (Fig. 1E). The requirement for ArgRIII in the interaction between Mcm1 and ArgRI, or between the two MADS-box proteins and ArgRII, is probably owing to the strong reduction of Mcm1 and ArgRI levels rather than to a direct bridging effect (see section on Mcm1 and ArgRI stability). In the case of ArgRII and ArgRIII, in which no interaction was observed, the overexpression of ArgRI or Mcm1 did not promote the formation of a functional activating complex (data not shown).

ArgRIII interacts with an a helix present in the MADS-box domain of ArgRI and Mcm1 To identify speci®c domains of ArgRI that mediate interaction with ArgRIII, we introduced into the GBD-ARGRI plasmid point mutations and deletions shown previously to alter the regulatory function of native ArgRI (see Experimental procedures). The deletions created (see Fig. 2) result in the loss of residues 1±74 (lane 2), residues 83± 93 (lane 3), residues 89±100 (lane 4), residues 104±111 (lane 5), residues 131±139 (lane 6) and residues 156± 160 (lane 7). The point mutations result in the replacement of Ala-109 by Thr (lane 8), Leu-115 by His (lane 9) and Gly148 by Asp (lane 10). The mutations altering residues 109

and 148 were obtained using in vivo selection (BJ104 and BJ102) (Qiu et al., 1990). Of four argRI mutants independently selected in vivo, three were found to result from the replacement of Gly-148 by Asp (BJ102, BJ103 and GE1) (Qiu et al., 1990 and E. Goossens, unpublished results). All the mutations mentioned result in at least partial loss of ArgRI function, except the deletion of the 74 N-terminal amino acids (data not shown). The deletion of amino acids 89±100 strongly reduces the interaction with ArgRIII, and the deletion of amino acids 104±111 also has a signi®cant effect (see Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 5). Thus, the region of ArgRI around amino acids 89±114, containing the N-terminal MADS-box a helix, seems to be required for its interaction with ArgRIII. This was con®rmed by fusing the regions from amino acids 75±120 (lane 11) and from amino acids 119±162 (lane 12) to GBD. Only the hybrid protein, GBD-argRI-75±120, interacts with GAD-ArgRIII (see Fig. 2, lanes 11 and 12). To de®ne more precisely the amino acids in the a helix involved in this interaction, we have created a series of mutations in that domain. The replacement of Arg-94 (lane 14) or His-95 by Gly (lane 16) reduces the ef®ciency of interactions, as does the replacement of both histidine residues, 95 and 103, by Asp and Arg (lane 18). The simultaneous replacement of the three residues Arg-94, His-95 and His-103 by Gly, Asp and Arg respectively (lane 19) totally abolishes the interaction between the a helix of ArgRI and ArgRIII, as does replacement of both arginine residues 101 and 102 by Gly (lane 20). In contrast, the replacements of Glu-89 by His (lane 13), His-95 by Asp (lane 15) and His-103 by Arg (lane 17) have no effect on the interaction. The loss of interaction between the mutated ArgRI a helix and ArgRIII could result from the different changes in amino acids, or from an instability of the mutated proteins. All the attempts to detect the different wild type or mutated GBD-ArgRI fusion proteins using Western blot analysis employing antibodies raised against ArgRI or the Gal4-binding domain (GBD) have failed. To determine whether the residues of ArgRI involved in its interaction with ArgRIII are required for its regulatory function, we have analysed the behaviour of one of the mutants that abolish the interaction. The monocopy plasmid, pFV24, with ARGRI carrying nucleotide changes leading to the replacement of Arg-101±Arg-102 by Gly± Gly (see Experimental procedures), was introduced in the deletant argRI strain (02463d-DRI). The transformed

Recruitment of two yeast MADS-box proteins by ArgIII 19 strain does not grow with ornithine as the sole nitrogen source, and has lost the repression of the arginine anabolic genes and the induction of the arginine catabolic genes (data not shown). As the a helix of Mcm1 is very similar to that of ArgRI, we fused the region from amino acids 15±56 from Mcm1 to GBD to test the ability of this hybrid protein to interact with GAD-ArgRIII. This domain of Mcm1 is also suf®cient to interact with ArgRIII (see Fig. 2, lanes 22 and 23). Moreover, the replacement of Arg-39 and Lys-40 by Gly±Gly (lane 24) in the a helix domain of Mcm1 also leads to loss of interaction between GBD-Mcm1-15±56± Arg-39±Lys-40!Gly±Gly and GAD-ArgRIII. These two amino acids correspond to amino acids Arg-101 and Arg102 in ArgRI.

In vitro association of ArgRIII with ArgRI and Mcm1 To provide biochemical evidence for an interaction between ArgRIII and the two MADS-box proteins, we carried out GST pull-down experiments, using bacterially expressed GSTArgRIII and semipuri®ed yeast extracts overexpressing ArgRI or Mcm1 (see Experimental procedures). Equivalent amounts of GST-ArgRIII and GST proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were incubated with yeast extracts, containing ArgRI or Mcm1 proteins. After being extensively washed, bound proteins were visualized using Western blotting with one antibody (anti-GST-Mcm1) to detect Mcm1, and two antibodies to detect ArgRI (anti-GST±ArgRI and anti-ArgRI±C-terminal peptide). As expected, GST alone did not interact detectably with Mcm1 (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2) or ArgRI (Fig. 3B and C, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, signi®cant amounts of full-length Mcm1 and Mcm1 degraded products bound to GST-ArgRIII (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4). For ArgRI, using anti-GST±ArgRI antibodies, we observed that only immobilized GST-ArgRIII retained ArgRI and degradation products (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). As GST and ArgRI proteins migrate at about the same position in SDS±page gels, the ArgRI protein was also revealed using anti-ArgRI antibodies raised against a C-terminal ArgRI peptide (Fig. 3C).

The open reading frames of the different argRI proteins and of two different Mcm1 proteins were fused in frame with the span encoding the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (GBD). ARGRIII was fused in frame with the span encoding the Gal4 activation domain (GAD). Transcription activation of the lacZ reporter gene was estimated by determination of bgalactosidase activity, which was measured at 308C on extracts of at least three independent transformants and the standard error was typically 10±15% of the mean. The speci®c activity is expressed in nanomoles of o-nitrophenyl-b-D-galactopyranoside hydrolysed per minute per milligram of protein.

interactions between ArgRI, Mcm1 and ArgRII. Futhermore, we have evidence of the presence of these proteins in the protein complex binding to the `arginine boxes' in an arginine-dependent fashion. ArgRI and Mcm1 also interact with ArgRIII, but this is not an indication of the presence of ArgRIII in the regulatory complex. ArgRI or Mcm1, when overexpressed, suppress, in vivo, the requirement of ArgRIII for the regulation of the arginine metabolism (Qiu et al., 1990). We have therefore investigated whether the requirement of ArgRIII in vitro (in gel shift assays) could also be restored by overexpression of ArgRI and Mcm1. Binding assays were performed using extracts from an argRIII deletant that overproduced ArgRI, Mcm1, ArgRII or ArgRIII. Overproduction of ArgRI or Mcm1 restored the formation of the two arginine-dependent complexes between the ArgR-Mcm1 proteins and the `arginine boxes' as ef®ciently as overproduction of ArgRIII (Fig. 4, lanes 3±4 and 5±6 compared with 7±8), although, in vivo, only overexpression of both proteins completely restored the regulation of arginine metabolism. Overproduction of ArgRII has no such effect either in vitro

or in vivo (lane 2 compared with lane 1). The regulatory complexes are thus able, in an arginine-dependent fashion, to interact with DNA in the absence of ArgRIII. Thus, the role of ArgRIII in the control of arginine metabolism could be to maintain a suf®cient level of ArgRI and Mcm1.

Determination of the stability of ArgRI and Mcm1 in wild-type and argRIII deletant strains Preliminary results suggested that the Mcm1 protein, but not its mRNA, was less abundant in an argRIII-deleted strain (Dubois and Messenguy, 1994), indicating that the impairment of arginine regulation in such a strain could result from a lack of Mcm1 and probably ArgRI proteins. We have examined the stability of both proteins in the wild type and in argRIII-deleted strains. To detect both proteins using Western blot in the argRIII background, Mcm1 and ArgRI were produced under the control of the GAL10 promoter. Two techniques were used to arrest Mcm1 synthesis. In one case, the addition of cycloheximide to the culture blocked general protein synthesis. In Q 2000 Blackwell Science Ltd, Molecular Microbiology, 35, 15±31


Recruitment of two yeast MADS-box proteins by ArgIII 21 suggesting in vivo proteolysis (data not shown). The role of ArgRIII in stabilizing ArgRI was con®rmed by further analysis of the argRI-R101G,R102G mutated protein, which did not interact with ArgRIII in the two-hybrid analysis (see Fig. 2, lane 21). To compare the stability of wild type and mutated ArgRI proteins in an ARGRIII wildtype background, we also expressed the mutated argRI gene under the dependence of the GAL10 promoter, generating plasmid pFV80. After the addition of cycloheximide, the mutated ArgRI protein was more rapidly degraded than the wild-type protein, although at time zero the amount of argRI-R101G,R102G was higher than ArgRI in an argRIII mutant strain. It was not possible to shift the cells from galactose to glucose medium because removal of galactose by ®ltering or centrifuging the cells led to the total disappearance of wild-type ArgRI protein. It is worth noting that the stability of the MADS-box proteins, ArgRI and Mcm1, with 56% identity in their functional regions, is strikingly different.

The end-labelled 160 bp AluI±AluI DNA fragment, containing the ARG5,6 `arginine boxes' (about 1 ng), was incubated with 10 mg of puri®ed yeast extract (see Experimental procedures).

In all binding assays, 1 mM -arginine was added, except in lanes 4, 6 and 8.

the second case, cells were shifted from low glucose (0.5%)  galactose medium to 3% glucose medium. The presence of glucose in the galactose medium avoided toxicity as a result of the very high level of Mcm1. Mcm1 amounts were detected by Western blot, using antibodies raised against puri®ed GST-Mcm1. As shown in Fig. 5A and B, the amount of Mcm1 (produced from pME105) is strongly reduced at time zero in the argRIII deletant compared with the wild-type strain (compare lanes 1±7). Both types of experiments demonstrate that the rate of Mcm1 degradation is strongly increased in the argRIII deletant background. In the wild-type background, Mcm1 is a very stable protein, whereas, in an argRIII-deleted strain, Mcm1 is undetectable 2 h after the addition of cycloheximide. As shown in Fig. 6, the amount of ArgRI (produced from pME51) is also strongly reduced in the argRIII deletant compared with the wild-type strain, and ArgRI protein is more rapidly degraded after the addition of cycloheximide (compare Fig. 6A and C). Using antibodies raised against GST-ArgRI, we always detected two bands, and the lower molecular weight band disappeared when antibodies raised against a C-terminal ArgRI peptide were used, Q 2000 Blackwell Science Ltd, Molecular Microbiology, 35, 15±31

Nuclear localization of ArgRIII The recruitment of ArgRI and Mcm1 by ArgRIII seems to be required to stabilize them. This recruitment could operate either in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus. Using ArgRIII±b-galactosidase fusion protein, we have previously obtained an indication as to the nuclear localization of ArgRIII, as for the other regulatory components of the system (Bercy et al., 1987). According to our results using isolated nuclei, 60% of ArgRIII was in the nucleus, but this technique could not distinguish whether the residual b-galactosidase activity in the cytoplasm was real or the result of a leak of nuclei during the experimental procedure. To investigate further the subcellular localization of ArgRIII, we fused the enhanced green ¯uorescent protein (GFP) coding sequence at the C-terminal end of the ArgRIII coding sequence (see Experimental procedures). This fusion protein was expressed under the dependence of the MET25 promoter. The plasmid containing the ARGRIII-GFP hybrid gene was introduced into the wildtype strain (02463d). GFP ¯uorescence was detected in living yeast cells using green ¯uorescence microscopy. With GFP protein alone entire cells ¯uoresce, whereas ArgRIIIGFP is clearly focused in an organelle (Fig. 7), and is totally absent in the cytoplasm. As clearly shown in the overlay, the localization of the green ¯uorescence seems to be con®ned primarily in the organelle stained by the TO-PRO3, a ¯uorescent DNA stain (Haugland, 1996), namely in the nucleus. ArgRIII seems thus to operate only in the nucleus.

ArgRIII is crucial for Mcm1 function We have previously shown that ArgRIII is also required for the expression of a- and a-speci®c genes controlled by

Mcm1 (Dubois and Messenguy, 1994). Here we analyse the involvement of ArgRIII in the control of other Mcm1dependent genes. We selected six promoters, controlled by Mcm1, SWI4, CDC6, CLN3, PIS1, PMA1 and FAR1, and fused them to the lacZ gene (Kuo and Grayhack, 1994; Oehlen et al., 1996; McInerny et al., 1997). The resulting plasmids (see Experimental procedures), pFV55 (CLN3-lacZ ), pFV56 (FAR1-lacZ ), pFV57 (PIS1lacZ ), pFV58 (CDC6-lacZ ), pFV59 (SWI4-lacZ ) and pFV60 (PMA1-lacZ ) were used to transform the wildtype strain (02463d), the argRIII-deleted strain (02463dDRIII) and the mcm1-gcn4/DE(Q) strain (Christ and Tye, 1991). As shown in Table 2, the b-galactosidase-speci®c activities are strongly reduced in the mcm1-gcn4/DE(Q) mutant strain and also reduced, but to a lesser extent, in the argRIII-deleted strain. The PMA1 gene, whose expression seems less dependent on Mcm1, is not regulated by ArgRIII, suggesting that the residual amount of Mcm1 in an argRIII deletant strain is suf®cient for PMA1 expression. To con®rm that the reduction of expression of all those genes results from a lack of Mcm1, we transformed the different strains with a multicopy plasmid carrying the MCM1 gene (pED40). As shown in Table 2, overexpression of Mcm1 in an argRIII background restored the expression of the different genes under its

control. However, the levels were still weaker than in a wild-type strain, which is in agreement with the lower amount of Mcm1 in an argRIII-deleted strain (see Western blot in Fig. 5). As expected, overexpression of ArgRI (02463d±DRIII strain transformed with pFV20 plasmid) has no such an effect.

Discussion Using different approaches, we have shown that repression of the arginine-anabolic enzymes and induction of the arginine-catabolic enzymes require the integrity of four proteins (ArgRI, ArgRII, ArgRIII and Mcm1). These proteins are necessary for the in vitro formation of a protein±DNA complex, with DNA containing the `arginine boxes'. We have previously provided evidence that ArgRI, ArgRII and Mcm1 are components of the complex. The data obtained in this work with the two-hybrid system show that ArgRI and Mcm1, two MADS-box proteins, interact together and with ArgRII and ArgRIII. The direct interactions between ArgRIII and the two MADS-box proteins have been con®rmed in vitro using af®nity chromatography. Although the requirement for an effector in association with proteins has already been reported for the interaction Q 2000 Blackwell Science Ltd, Molecular Microbiology, 35, 15±31

between the Snf1 protein kinase and Snf4, which is strongly regulated by the glucose signal (Jiang and Carlson, 1996), the presence of arginine in the growth medium did not facilitate the observed interactions between proteins (data not shown). However, arginine is required for the formation of a protein±DNA complex with the `arginine boxes'. Its role could be to stabilize the complex formed between ArgRI, Mcm1 and ArgRII, rather than to recruit the different regulatory proteins. It is worth noting that the Escherichia coli ArgR repressor is a hexamer protein. The C-terminal domain, which contains the arginine binding sites, is required for its oligomerization. A consequence of arginine binding to ArgR would be a stabilization of the hexamer and a conformational change that would play a role in orienting the DNA-binding domains to form an appropriate binding surface to bind arginine boxes (Van Duyne et al., 1996). As ArgRII contains two regions of similarity with the C-terminal domain of E. coli ArgR (Messenguy and Dubois, 1988), arginine could bind to ArgRII, leading to stabilization of the regulatory complex and induction of an adequate conformational change favouring the binding of the complex to `arginine boxes'.

The interactions between ArgRI, Mcm1, ArgRII and ArgRIII do not require the integrity of the other components of the regulatory system, as they are not impaired in a strain deleted for ARGRI and ARGRII genes. However, the absence of ArgRIII affects the interactions between Mcm1 or ArgRI and their partners. This is probably owing to the low level of Mcm1 and ArgRI in an argRIII deletant strain, and not because ArgRIII serves as a bridge between the other components. The interactions between the different proteins seem thus to be direct, as the other regulators do not serve as bridging proteins. We have further exploited the two-hybrid system to identify regions of ArgRI and Mcm1 involved in their interaction with ArgRIII. In ArgRI, the region around amino acids 89±114, presenting an a helix structure well conserved among the `MADS-box' proteins, is suf®cient to interact with ArgRIII, and mutations in this region impair the interaction. Similarly, the a helix structure of the Mcm1 MADS-box (from amino acids 15±56) also interacts with ArgRIII. Although ArgRIII is required in vivo to repress the expression of the arginine-anabolic genes and induce Fig. 7. Cellular distribution of ArgRIII±GFP.

Each strain was transformed with the following plasmids: pFV55 (CLN3±lacZ, URA3), pFV56 (FAR1±lacZ, URA3), pFV57 (PIS1±lacZ, URA3), pFV58 (CDC6±lacZ, URA3), pFV59 (SW14±lacZ, URA3) and pFV60 (PMA1±lacZ, URA3). At least three independent transformants were tested, and the standard error was 15% of the mean. The specific activity is expressed in nanomoles of o-nitrophenyl-b-D-galactopyranoside hydrolysed per minute per milligram of protein.

the expression of arginine-catabolic genes in the presence of arginine, some evidence indicates that ArgRIII is not a component of the regulatory complex interacting with DNA. Moreover, the requirement for ArgRIII can be bypassed in vitro, as well as in vivo, by overproducing ArgRI or Mcm1. Our results demonstrate that the ArgRIII interactions with the two MADS-box proteins stabilize them. Indeed, in an argRIII deletant strain the stability of ArgRI and Mcm1 is strongly reduced, and the argRI± R102G,R102G, which cannot interact with ArgRIII, remains unstable in a wild-type strain. The stabilization by ArgRIII of these MADS-box proteins could occur either in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus. The absence of ArgRIII-GFP in the cytoplasm is in favour of its role in the nucleus where its two partners ArgRI and Mcm1 have to ful®l their function. The precise role of ArgRIII is still questionable. The comparison of its sequence with the different eukaryotic data bases revealed some similarity with the yeast Kcs1 protein (a BZIP potential transcription factor as described in the data bases; Huang and Symington, 1995) and human, rabbit, C. elegans and Schizosaccharomyces pombe homologues (see Fig. 8). This observation does not shed light on the ArgRIII function, as three of the four leucine residues of the BZIP domain of Kcs1 are not conserved either in ArgRIII or in the other homologues. Moreover, no data support a role for Kcs1 in transcription. Mutations in KSC1 or PTC1 genes (PTC1 encoding a serine±threonine protein phosphatase) suppress the temperature-sensitive growth defect of the pkc1-4 allele. The kcs1D, ptc1D double mutant fails to grow at 308C,

and ptc1D is synthetically lethal in combination with a mutation in MPK1, encoding a MAP homologue acting in the Pkc1 pathway (Huang and Symington, 1995). These data suggest that Kcs1 could function in the Pkc1 pathway, for example by regulating the expression of a phosphatase gene. However, these authors have shown that expression of the phosphatase genes, PTP2 and PTC1, is not regulated by Kcs1. As Kcs1 shares some similarity with ArgRIII, a putative role for Kcs1 could be to stabilize some proteins, such as protein phosphatases. As shown in this paper, many of the metabolic and cellular defects observed in an argRIII mutant result from a lack of Mcm1 as they are overcome by overexpression of Mcm1. However, this is not the case for the sporulation de®ciency of argRIII±argRIII diploid strain and for the absence of growth at 378C (Dubois and Messenguy, 1994), suggesting that ArgRIII is likely to interact with other proteins. ArgRIII does not seem to recruit the other two yeast MADS-box proteins, Rlm1 and Smp1 (Dodou and Treisman, 1997; Watanabe et al., 1997) as they did not interact with ArgRIII in our two-hybrid experiments (data not shown). It is noteworthy that the a helices of Smp1 and Rlm1 are not as well conserved as those of ArgRI, Mcm1 and human SRF. At present, we view the recruitment of ArgRI and Mcm1 by ArgRIII as the ®rst step in the sequence of events leading to their stabilization in the nucleus, where they can interact with ArgRII to form an active complex with DNA in the presence of arginine.

These strains have both the GAL4 and the GAL80 genes deleted and contain an integrated GAL1± lacZ reporter gene activated by UAS±GAL (URA3::GAL1!lacZ ) and an integrated GAL1±HIS3 reporter gene. Strain 02463d (MATa, leu2, ura3) was used to delete the ARGRI, ARGRII and ARGRIII genes, using the LFH-PCR (long ¯anking homology polymerase chain reaction) strategy of Wach (1996). The different coding sequences were replaced by the KanMX4 cassette, conferring, to yeast, a resistance to geneticin. Strains 02463d, 02463d-DRIII (ARGRIII::KanMX4), 02463d-DRI (ARGRI::KanMX4) and 02463d-DRII (ARGRII::KanMX4) were used as recipient strains for transformation with plasmids overexpressing ARGRI or MCM1 genes to perform gel shift assays and with plasmids expressing the GBD and GAD fusion proteins to test the functionality of the hybrid proteins.

Recruitment of two yeast MADS-box proteins by ArgIII 25 hybrid Mcm1 proteins, we transformed a diploid strain in which one copy of the MCM1 gene was replaced by the KanMX4 cassette. After transformation with the different plasmids containing the fused GBD-MCM1, GAD-MCM1 genes, the different diploids were grown on sporulation medium and the viability of the spores was tested. Strain mcm1±gcn4/DE(Q) (mcm1±gcn4, ura3, leu2, his3), a gift from B. K. Tye (Christ and Tye, 1991), was transformed with the plasmids containing the lacZ gene under the dependence of different Mcm1-regulated promoters. Plasmids used in gel retardation assays were the following: pED1 containing a 6 kb BamHI±BamHI DNA fragment with the ARGRII gene inserted in pBR322-URA3-2m (Dubois and Messenguy, 1985); pQH100 containing a 1.7 kb EcoRI±Sal I DNA fragment with the ARGRI gene inserted in pUC19-URA3-2m (Qiu et al., 1990); pED40 containing a 3.5 kb SphI±SphI DNA fragment with the MCM1 gene inserted in pUC19±LEU2±2m; pMJ36 containing a 1.7 kb HindIII±Sal I DNA fragment with the ARGRIII gene inserted in pBR322±LEU2±2m (Dubois and Messenguy, 1994). Plasmids used in the determination of ArgRI or Mcm1 stability were the following: for Mcm1, pME105; for ArgRI, pME51 and for argRI-R101G,R102G, pFV80. For these constructions, we synthesized the coding sequences of MCM1, ARGRI and argRI±R101G,R102G using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) employing oligonucleotides mcm1-1 and mcm1-2 and RI-10 and RI-13 respectively. Oligonucleotides mcm1-1 and RI-10 contain a BamHI site at the 58 end and oligonucleotides mcm1-2 and RI-13 contain a Not1 site at the 38 end (see Table 3). The BamHI±Not I fragments were inserted into the plasmid pYeF2 (Cullin and Minvielle-Sebastia, 1994), digested by BamHI and Not I, yielding plasmids pME105 (pGAL10-MCM1, 2m, URA3), pME51 (pGAL10ARGRI, 2m, URA3) and pFV80 (pGAL10-argRI-R101GR102G, 2m, URA3). Yeast cells were grown in synthetic medium, containing 0.7% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids. This medium was supplemented with 2% glucose and all amino acids except those whose omission was required for plasmid selection. For other types of experiments, except the two-hybrid system, all the yeast strains were grown on minimal medium, containing 3% glucose or 2% galactose or as otherwise stated in the text, vitamins and mineral traces as described by Messenguy (Messenguy, 1976). The nitrogen source was 0.02 M ammonium sulphate. The lithium acetate procedure (Ito et al., 1983) was used to transform the recipient yeast strains. Escherichia coli strains XL1B and JM109 from Stratagene were used for plasmid ampli®cation.

Construction of DNA-binding domain (GBD) and activation domain (GAD) fusions The DNA-binding domain of the Gal4 activator, Gal4(1±147), is referred to as GBD, and its activation domain, Gal4(768± 881), is referred to as GAD. GBD and GAD in italics refer to the DNA sequences encoding these domains. GBD-containing fusion genes were constructed in vector pAS2 (Durfee et al., 1993). Transformants harbouring the vector, or a derivative thereof, were selected by omitting tryptophan from the YNB medium. GAD-containing fusion genes

GBD-ARGRI and GAD-ARGRI fusions. To construct the GBD-ARGRI and GAD-ARGRI gene fusions, we used oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis to create a BamHI restriction site at the initiator codon of the ARGRI gene in plasmid pQKS1 [pBS(SK), bearing the ARGRI gene on a 1.9 kb EcoRI±KpnI fragment]. This yielded plasmid pME2. A BamHI linker was inserted into the T4-blunt-ended KpnI site of pME2 to obtain plasmid pYM3. The 1.7 kb BamHI±BamHI fragment of pYM3 was inserted into the BamHI site of plasmids pAS2 and pGAD2F to produce in frame GBDARGRI and GAD-ARGRI fusions in the resulting plasmids, pME46 (pGBD-ARGRI ) and pME21 (pGAD-ARGRI ). In these GBD-ARGRI and GAD-ARGRI fusions, we determined the nucleotide sequence of the junction between the GBD- or GAD-encoding region and the ARGRI gene to make sure that the fusions were in frame.

GBD-ARGRII and GAD-ARGRII fusions.

This yielded in frame GBD-ARGRII and GAD-ARGRII gene fusions in the resulting plasmids pNA33 (pGBD-ARGRII ) and pME9 (pGAD-ARGRII ). In these GBD-ARGRII and GADARGRII fusions, we determined the nucleotide sequence of the junction between the GBD- or GAD-encoding region and the ARGRII gene to make sure that the fusions were in frame. GBD-ARGRIII and GAD-ARGRIII fusions. To construct the GBD-ARGRIII and GAD-ARGRIII gene fusions, we used oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis to create a BamHI restriction site at the initiator codon of the ARGRIII gene in plasmid pKSRIII [pBS(SK) bearing the ARGRIII gene on a 1.7 kb HindIII±KpnI fragment].

1.3 kb BamHI±BamHI fragment of pME10 was inserted into the BamHI site of plasmids pAS2 and pGAD2F, thus yielding in frame GBD-ARGRIII and GAD-ARGRIII gene fusions. The resulting plasmids were pNA22 (pGBD-ARGRIII ) and pME18 (pGAD-ARGRIII ). In these GBD-ARGRIII and GAD-ARGRIII fusions, we determined the nucleotide sequence of the junction between the GBD- or GAD-encoding span and the ARGRIII gene to ensure that the fusions were in frame. GBD-MCM1 and GAD-MCM1 fusions. To construct the GBD-MCM1 and GAD-MCM1 gene fusions, we used oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis to create a BamHI restriction site at the initiator codon of the MCM1 gene in plasmid pKSM [pBS(SK), bearing the MCM1 gene on a 3.5 kb SphI±SphI fragment]. This yielded plasmid pME14. A BamHI linker was inserted into the T4-blunt-ended ClaI site of pME14 to obtain plasmid pME15. The 0.9 kb BamHI± BamHI fragment of pME15 was inserted into the BamHI site of plasmids pAS2 and pGAD2F, yielding in-frame GBDMCM1 and GAD-MCM1 gene fusions. The corresponding plasmids are called pNA51 (pGBD-MCM1) and pME19 (pGAD-MCM1). In these GBD-MCM1 and GAD-MCM1 fusions, we determined the nucleotide sequence of the junction between the GBD- or GAD-encoding sequence and the MCM1 gene to ensure that the fusions were in frame. GBD-argRI fusions containing different mutations in the ARGRI gene. To construct plasmids bearing GBD fused to a mutated or partially deleted argRI gene, we ®rst used oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis to create a series of mutations (point mutations and deletions; see Table 3) in plasmid pYM3 [pBS(SK)] or pME66 (pALTER-1), bearing the ARGRI gene on a 1.7kb BamHI±BamHI fragment. The resulting mutant plasmids were pNA3 (argRIAla-109!Thr), pNA7(argRIGly-148!Asp),pME49(argRILeu-115!His),pEJ3 (argRID1±74), pME67 (argRID83±93), pME78 (argRID89± 100), pME55 (argRID104±111), pME63 (argRID131±139) and pNA2 (argRID156±160). The BamHI±BamHI fragments of these plasmids were inserted into the BamHI site of plasmid pAS2, thus producing in frame fusions between the GBD sequence and the mutated argRI gene. The resulting plasmids were: pME31 (for protein GBD-argRID1±74), pME70 (GBDargRID83±93), pME80 (GBD-argRID89±100), pME56 (GBDargRID104±111), pME65 (GBD-argRID131±139), pME28 (GBD-argRID156±160), pME30 (GBD-argRIAla-109!Thr), pME44 (GBD-argRIGly-148!Asp) and pME47 (GBD-argRILeu-115!His). To produce the construct encoding the GBDargRI-75±120 fusion protein, we ®rst used PCR to synthesize a 135bp BamHI±BamHI DNA fragment containing nucleotides 225±360 (1 ATG) of the ARGRI gene. The primers used were oligonucleotides RI-5 and RI-19 (see Table 3), based on the published ARGRI sequence (Dubois et al., 1987), each ¯anked by a BamHI restriction site. The 135bp BamHI± BamHI fragment was inserted into the BamHI site of plasmid pAS2. The resulting plasmid was pME82 (GBD-argRI-75±120).

Recruitment of two yeast MADS-box proteins by ArgIII 27 fragment was inserted into the BamHI site of plasmid pAS2. The resulting plasmid was pME94 (GBD-argRI-119±162). To produce the constructs encoding the GBD-argRI-75± 120Glu-89!Lys, GBD-argRI-75±120Arg-94!Gly, GBDargRI-75±120His-95!Asp, GBD-argRI-75±120His-95!Gly, GBD-argRI-75±120His-103!Arg, GBD-argRI-75±120His-95

±Arg-102!Gly±Gly fusion proteins, we ®rst used oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis to create these mutations (see Table 3) in plasmid pME66 (pALTER-1 vector containing a 1.7kb BamHI±BamHI DNA fragment containing the entire ARGRI gene). The resulting mutant plasmids were pME83 (argRIGlu-89!Lys), pME124 (argRIArg-94!Gly), pME84 (argRIHis-95!Asp), pME125 (argRIHis-95!Gly), pME85 (argRIHis-103!Arg), pME96 (argRIHis-95±His-103!Asp± Arg), pME127 (argRIArg-94±His-95±His-103!Gly±Asp±Arg) and pME126 (argRIArg-101±Arg-102!Gly±Gly). Second, we used PCR to amplify the BamHI±BamHI mutated fragments, containing nucleotides 225±360, from these plasmids. As primers we used oligonucleotides RI-5 and RI-19 (see Table 3), each ¯anked by a BamHI restriction site. The different 135bp BamHI±BamHI mutated fragments were inserted into the BamHI site of plasmid pAS2. The resulting plasmids were pME88 (GBD-argRI-75±120Glu-89!Lys), pME115 (GBDargRI-75±120Arg-94!Gly), pME90 (GBD-argRI-75±120His95!Asp), pME116 (GBD-argRI-75±120His-95!Gly), pME92 (GBD-argRI-75±120His-103!Arg), pME98 (GBD-argRI-75± 120His-95-His-103!Asp-Arg), pME108 (GBD-argRI-75± 120Arg-94±His-95±His-103!Gly±Asp±Arg) and pME117 (GBD-argRI-75±120Arg-101±Arg-102!Gly±Gly). The double mutation Arg-101±Arg-102!Gly±Gly was also created in GBD-argRI-1±177, using PCR to amplify the BamHI±BamHI DNA mutated fragment, containing nucleotides 225±666 (pFV8), from plasmid pME126. In all these GBD-argRI gene fusions, we sequenced the junction between the GBD-encoding span and the argRI gene, to make sure that the fusions were in frame. All these fragments were sequenced to verify that there were no errors introduced by PCR. To establish whether the mutated protein had an argRI phenotype, the double mutation Arg-101±Arg-102!Gly±Gly was also created in the cognate ARGRI gene by in vitro mutagenesis of plasmid pEJ26 (pALTER-1 bearing a 1.7kb EcoRI±SalI DNA fragment, using oligonucleotide RI-35, yielding plasmid pFV23). This mutated fragment was inserted in pFL38 plasmid (Bonneaud et al., 1991) to give plasmid pFV24. GBD-mcm1 15±56 fusion. To produce the construct encoding the GBD-mcm1±15±56 fusion protein, we ®rst used PCR to synthesize a 123 bp BamHI±BamHI DNA fragment, containing nucleotides 45±168 (1  ATG) of the MCM1 gene. The primers used were oligonucleotides Mcm1-8 and Mcm1-9 (see Table 3), based on the published MCM1 sequence (Passemore et al., 1988), each ¯anked by a BamHI restriction site. The 123 bp BamHI±BamHI fragment was inserted into the BamHI site of plasmid pAS2. The resulting plasmid was pME100 (GBD-mcm1-15±56). In this GBDmcm1 gene fusion, we sequenced the junction between the GBD-encoding span and the mcm1 gene to ensure that the fusions were in frame. All these fragments were sequenced to verify that there were no errors introduced by the PCR. Using site-directed mutagenesis (Quick change site-directed

mutagenesis from Stratagene), plasmid pME100 was used to create the following changes: Arg-39±Lys-40!Gly±Gly. The primers used were the two complementary oligonucleotides, Mcm1-27 and Mcm1-28, carrying the desired mutations. The plasmid containing the GBD-mcm1-15±56-Arg-39±Lys40!Gly±Gly was named pFV41.

Construction of ArgRIII±GFP fusion To produce the construct encoding ArgRIII±GFP, we ®rst used PCR to synthesize a BamHI±BamHI DNA fragment, containing nucleotides 1±1065 of the ARGRIII gene (1  ATG). The primers used were oligonucleotides RIII-16 and RIII-14 (see Table 3), based on the published ARGRIII sequences (Dubois et al., 1987), each ¯anked by a BamHI restriction site. The BamHI±BamHI fragment was inserted into the BamHI site of plasmid pUG35 (containing URA3,CEN6/ARS4 and the gene encoding the yeast-enhanced green ¯uorescent protein; U. GuÈldener and J. H. Hegemann, in preparation) to produce the in-frame ArgRIII±GFP fusion protein in plasmid pFV28 (ARGRIII±GFP ). In this fusion, we sequenced the junction between ARGRIII and the GFP gene to make sure that the fusion was in frame. The fragment was sequenced to verify that there were no errors introduced by PCR. The yeast cells transformed with the plasmids expressing GFP or ArgRIII-GFP proteins were examined on an MRC1024 laser scanning confocal microscope, after being treated with a 1:100 diluted solution of TP-PRO3 for 1 h at room temperature (Haugland, 1996). The emission ®lters were 522DF32 for GFP ¯uorescence and 680DF32 for TOPRO3. The single and two colour merged images were constructed from grey scale confocal ¯uorescent images with

regions homologous to ARGRI, ARGRII or ARGRIII, were synthesized using PCR. These two cassettes confer to yeast a resistance to geneticin (G418) and allow growth in medium without histidine. The homologous regions of each gene were located upstream from the start codon and downstream from the stop codon. The PCR protocols for preparation of these cassettes were identical to those described in the original articles (Wach et al., 1994; 1996). Thus, the diploid strain (HY) was ®rst transformed with different DNA fragments, containing the KanMX4 cassette ¯anked by regions homologous to ARGRI, ARGRII or ARGRIII genes. To disrupt the second allele of each gene, the transformants resistant to geneticin were retransformed by the different fragments containing the HIS3MX6 cassette ¯anked by regions homologous to ARGRI, ARGRII or ARGRIII genes. Integration of the KanMX4 and HIS3MX6 cassettes at the target loci was con®rmed using the PCR strategy as described by Wach (1996).

Enzyme assay b-Galactosidase activity was assayed as described by Miller (1972). Protein contents were determined using the Folin method.

Fusions of CLN3, FAR1, PIS1, PMA1, CDC6 and SWI4 promoters to lacZ gene Fragments of about 1000 bp, containing the promoter and the ®rst three codons of each gene, were produced using PCR employing appropriate oligonucleotides based on Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic data and each extended with BamHI restriction site. These fragments were fused in frame to the lacZ coding sequence by insertion in the BamHI site of plasmid pMC310 [pFL1, containing the E. coli lacZ gene inserted at the BamHI site (Casadaban et al., 1980), a gift from M. Crabeel], yielding plasmids CLN3±lacZ (pFV55), FAR1±lacZ (pFV56), PIS1±lacZ (pFV57), PMA1± lacZ (pFV58), CDC6±lacZ (pFV59) and SWI4±lacZ (pFV60). In each case, we determined the nucleotide sequence of the junction between the promoter and the lacZ gene, to ensure that the fusions were in frame.

DNA manipulation and DNA sequencing Restriction reactions were performed as recommended by the enzyme supplier. Blunt-ended DNA fragments were created with T4 DNA polymerase, using standard methods described by Maniatis et al. (1982). DNA fragments were isolated from agarose gels using Geneclean. Plasmid DNA was prepared using the alkaline lysis method (Birmboim and Doly, 1979) or rapid-boiling lysis (Holmes and Quigley, 1981). Both single-stranded DNA and denatured double-stranded DNA were used as templates for DNA sequencing. Preparation of single-stranded DNA templates was carried out as described by Messing (1983). Double-stranded DNA was prepared using Qiagen columns. DNA was sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method of Sanger et al. (1977) with oligonucleotides being used as primers. Sitedirected in vitro mutagenesis was performed with the Sculptor in vitro mutagenesis system from Amersham, the Altered sites II in vitro mutagenesis system from Promega or the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene.

Deletion of ARGRI, ARGRII and ARGRIII genes The deletion of ARGRI, ARGRII or ARGRIII genes in the diploid strain (HY), used as recipient strain in the two-hybrid experiments, was performed using the PCR strategy developed by Wach (1996). The two disruption cassettes, containing the KanMX4 and HIS3MX6 cassettes with long ¯anking

Gel retardation assays Extract preparation and the binding assays were performed as has been described by Dubois and Messenguy (1991). For binding studies, a 160 bp AluI±AluI fragment, containing the control region of the ARG5,6 gene was end-labelled with [g-32]-ATP (Amersham), using polynucleotide kinase by the standard method (Maniatis et al., 1982). Western blot analysis For ArgRI and Mcm1 detection, 25 ml of exponentially growing cells were harvested using centrifugation, and the proteins were extracted using the TCA method described by Clontech.

About 50 mg of total proteins were electrophorezed in a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing sodium dodecyl sulphate as described by Laemmli (1970). After electrotransfer of proteins to Hybond membrane, speci®c proteins were detected with polyclonal antibodies raised against GST±ArgRI and GST± Mcm1 obtained by injection of these puri®ed proteins in mice. The antibodies were a gift from Paul Jacobs. Preparation of anti-ArgRI antibodies, raised against a C-terminal peptide of ArgRI was performed as has been described by Dubois and Messenguy (1991). After incubation with antimouse immunoglobulin G-speci®c antibody conjugate to horseradish peroxidase, peroxidase activity was revealed with the enhanced chemiluminescence kit as speci®ed by the supplier (Boehringer Mannheim). For the determination of ArgRI and Mcm1 stabilities, at time zero, we added 20 mg mlÀ cycloheximide or the cells were shifted from

In vitro protein±protein interaction The entire coding sequence of ARGRIII was cloned into the BamHI site of the pGEX-5X-3 vector as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion, resulting in plasmid pME54. After transfection into E. coli strain XL1-B, induction of the fusion gene was achieved by the addition of 500 mM isopropyl b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 3 h at 378C. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in PBS buffer (140 mM NaCl; 2.7 mM KCl; 10 mM Na2HPO4; 1.8 mM KH2PO4) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors, and sonicated on ice for 3 min After spinning at 12 000 r.p.m. for 15 min, the supernatants were collected and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia) at 48C for 1 h. In addition, the GST moiety was independently immobilized on glutathione±agarose beads. After being washed, the beads were split into several portions for subsequent binding experiments. Semi-puri®ed yeast extracts (100 mg) (Dubois and Messenguy, 1991), overexpressing ArgRI or Mcm1 proteins (20 ng), were incubated overnight at 48C with GST±ArgRIII fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. After being extensively washed with cold PBS buffer, the beads were boiled in sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) loading buffer and samples were electrophorezed through SDS 10% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to Hybond membrane and detected using Western analysis with polyclonal antibodies raised against GST±Mcm1, GST±ArgRI and a C-terminal ArgRI peptide (Dubois and Messenguy, 1991). Peroxidase activity was revealed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit as speci®ed by the supplier (Boehringer Mannheim). Acknowledgments We thank S. Fields, S. Elledge, J. H. Hegemann and O. Louvet for the gifts of plasmids and strains, and P. Jacobs for providing antibodies raised against GST-ArgRI and GSTMcm1 proteins. We thank B.
