Yeast RLM1 Encodes a Serum Response Factor-Like Protein That May Function Downstream of the Mpk1 (Slt2) Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Pathway

YASUYUKI WATANABE, KENJI IRIE,* AND KUNIHIRO MATSUMOTO Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, Nagoya University, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya 464-01, Japan Received 26 May 1995/Returned for modification 27 June 1995/Accepted 17 July 1995 The MPK1 (SLT2) gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a mitogen-activated protein kinase that is regulated by a kinase cascade whose known elements are Pkc1 (a homolog of protein kinase C), Bck1 (Slk1) (a homolog of MEK kinase), and the functionally redundant Mpk1 activators Mkk1 and Mkk2 (homologs of MEK). An activated mutation of MKK1, MKK1P386, inhibits growth when overexpressed. This growth-inhibitory effect was suppressed by the mpk1 mutation, suggesting that hyperactivation of the Mpk1 pathway is toxic to cells. To search for genes that interact with the Mpk1 pathway, we isolated both chromosomal mutations and dosage suppressor genes that ameliorate the growth-inhibitory effect of overexpressed Mkk1P386. One of the genes identified by the analysis of chromosomal mutations is RLM1 (resistance to lethality of MKK1P386 overexpression), which encodes a protein homologous to a conserved domain of the MADS (Mcm1, Agamous, Deficiens, and serum response factor) box family of transcription factors. Although rlm1 cells grow normally at any temperature, they display a caffeine-sensitive phenotype similar to that observed in mutants defective in BCK1, MKK1/MKK2, or MPK1. A gene fusion that provides Rlm1 with a transcriptional activation domain of Gal4 suppresses bck1 and mpk1 . A screening for dosage suppressors yielded the MSG5 genes, which encode a dual-specificity protein phosphatase. Our results suggest that Rlm1 functions as a transcription factor downstream of Mpk1 that is subject to activation by the Mpk1 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.

Extracellular molecules that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation in eukaryotes depend on pathways that detect signals at the cell surface and transmit them through the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where transcription factors that are among the ultimate targets of such signaling pathways elicit alterations in gene expression that in turn regulate cellular events. One mechanism for transmitting these signals involves a protein phosphorylation cascade leading to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) or extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) (4, 35, 36). Thus, these enzymes are thought to function as intermediaries between membraneassociated signaling molecules and the nucleus. MAPKs/ ERKs are activated by tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation; both phosphorylation events are catalyzed by the dualspecificity protein kinase called MEK (MAPK kinase or ERK kinase). MEK itself is phosphorylated and activated by at least three upstream kinases, Raf, MEK kinase, and Mos (35). Each of these upstream components also functions in multiple cell signaling processes. Elements of the MAPK activation pathways appear to have been conserved across evolution, as the kinases that comprise MAPK pathways have been identified in organisms ranging from mammals to Saccharomyces cerevisiae (3, 21). In S. cerevisiae, there is presently evidence for at least four separate but structurally related MAPK activation pathways that mediate distinct responses to different extracellular or cell autonomous signals. First, the Mpk1 (Slt2) pathway is required for the

control of cell wall construction. Second, the Fus3/Kss1 pathway is activated by exposure of haploid yeast cells to mating pheromones. Third, the Hog1 pathway is activated by exposure of yeast cells to hyperosmolar environments and leads to increased glycerol biosynthesis. Fourth, the Smk1 pathway has been shown to be required for control of sporulation. Recently, extensive effort has been devoted to identifying the downstream targets of MAPKs. Among the direct targets of MAPKs that have been identified in mammalian systems are several transcription factors, including c-Fos, NF-IL-6, c-Jun, c-Myc, and p62TCF (1, 7, 23, 40, 48, 55). p62TCF is a ternary complex factor (TCF) and is recruited to the c-fos serum response element by interaction with the serum response factor (SRF) (59, 60). Recent findings indicate that phosphorylation of TCF occurs in response to activation of the MAPK pathway and that regulation of TCF activity is an important mechanism by which the serum response element responds to growth factor signals (24, 27, 28). However, although progress in identifying possible targets of MAPKs has been made, much remains to be learned about the downstream events caused by MAPK activation in vivo. S. cerevisiae is an attractive organism in which to identify and characterize MAPK targets because it is readily manipulated by genetic techniques. One of the MAPK pathways in S. cerevisiae the Mpk1 signaling cascade, is mediated by the yeast protein kinase C homolog, Pkc1, and consists of Bck1 (Slk1) and Mkk1/Mkk2, which are proposed to catalyze a protein phosphorylation cascade culminating in the activation of the Mpk1 MAPK homolog (9, 11, 26, 30, 31, 37, 38). The upstream activators of Mpk1 are the functionally redundant kinases Mkk1 and Mkk2, which share high sequence identity with MEK (26). Furthermore, the Bck1 kinase, which has been

demonstrated to function upstream of Mkk1/Mkk2, is closely related MEK kinase. Finally, a dominant allele of BCK1 can suppress pkc1 disruption, suggesting that Pkc1 is an upstream regulator of Bck1 function in this pathway, similar to protein kinase C regulation of MAPK pathways in other eukaryotes (31). Thus, genetic approaches identified these components and established that Bck1, Mkk1/Mkk2, and Mpk1 kinases act in that order in the Pkc1-mediated pathway (26, 30). This pathway is essential for integrity of the cell wall and also participates in nutrient sensing, growth control, and actin organization. The signal for activation of Pkc1 is unknown, and targets of Mpk1 have not yet been identified. Identification of such targets would contribute to an understanding of how the Pkc1-Mpk1 pathway directs downstream events. Mpk1 is suspected to phosphorylate a variety of substrates, including transcription factors, in a manner analogous to the Fus3/Kss1dependent activation of Ste12 (17). Previous attempts to identify downstream effectors of the Mpk1 pathway have exploited gene dosage (high-copy-number) suppressor analyses. Lee et al. (29) have identified the PPZ1, PPZ2, and BCK2 genes as multicopy suppressors of mpk1 deletion mutants. PPZ1 and PPZ2 encode a pair of type 1-related protein phosphatases, and BCK2 is a gene of unknown function (29, 47). Genetic and phenotypic analysis suggests that they do not function as components downstream of the Mpk1 pathway but rather appear to coordinately regulate components that function downstream of Mpk1. Similarly, Costigan et al. (10) have identified the NHP6A and NHP6B genes, which exhibit significant homology to each other, as suppressors of defects in the Mpk1 pathway. They encode proteins with DNA-binding domains similar to those of mammalian high-mobility-group proteins (10). Although Nhp6A and Nhp6B proteins do not appear to be direct targets of Mpk1 kinase, they are candidates for downstream components of Mpk1. We have recently identified a hyperactive mutation of MKK1, MKK1P386, resulting from the change of serine to proline at position 386 (65). This mutation site lies between protein kinase subdomains VII and VIII close to the putative phosphate acceptor residue(s), which is thought to be phosphorylated by Bck1. The MKK1P386 mutation is able to suppress both the pkc1 and bck1 deletion, indicating that the mutationally activated Mkk1 kinase transmits a signal even in the absence of Pkc1 and Bck1 upstream kinases. On the other hand, the MKK1P386 mutation fails to suppress defects associated with mpk1 mutations, consistent with a model in which Mkk1 acts upstream of Mpk1. In this study, we found that MKK1P386 inhibited growth when overexpressed by fusion to the strong GAL1 promoter. This growth-inhibitory effect was suppressed by the mpk1 deletion, indicating that hyperactivation of the Mpk1 pathway is toxic to yeast cells. We took advantage of this system to identify downstream components of the Mpk1 MAPK pathway. We isolated yeast strains harboring mutations in the RLM1 gene that were resistant to the growth inhibition caused by overexpression of MKK1P386. The RLM1 gene product belongs to the MADS (MCM1, Agamous, Deficiens, and SRF) family of transcription factors. The molecular and genetic analyses presented here suggest that Rlm1 functions downstream of Mpk1. MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains, media, and general methods.

other nutrients (e.g., SC-Ura lacks uracil) was used to score auxotrophies and to select transformants. YEPG and SG were identical to YEPD and SC, respectively, except that they contained 2% galactose instead of 2% glucose. YEPR was identical to YEPD except that it contained 2% raffinose instead of 2% glucose. Yeast cells were transformed by the lithium acetate method, using singlestranded DNA as the carrier (19). Other recombinant DNA procedures were carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (52). Plasmids. Plasmids pYS91 and pYS91W are YEp-based URA3 and TRP1 plasmids, respectively, containing the ACT1 gene under the control of GAL1 promoter (57). Plasmid YCpMPK1 is YCplac33 carrying the 2.3-kb EcoRI-SalI fragment of the MPK1 gene (30). Plasmids pYW52-3 and pYW52-4 were constructed by inserting the 4.9-kb SalI-SphI fragment of the RSP5 gene into YCplac33 and YCplac22, respectively. Plasmids pYW14-6, YEp181-RLM1, and YEp195-RLM1 were constructed by inserting the 3.5-kb PstI-SnaBI fragment of the RLM1 gene into YCplac33, YEp181, and YEp195, respectively. The Nterminal portion of the RLM1 coding sequence was amplified by PCR using a 5 primer (5 -AAAAGATCTTTATGGGTAGACGGAAGATTGAAAATCC-3 ) incorporating a BglII site and a 3 primer (5 -AAAGGATCCGGTTTCAATC TTT-3 ). A 590-bp BglII-BamHI fragment generated by PCR and a 2.0-kbp BamHI-PstI fragment containing the C-terminal portion of RLM1 were inserted into the BamHI-PstI gap of YCpG33 (13) and the BamHI-SalI gap of pACTII (32) to generate YCpG33-RLM1 and pACT-RLM1, respectively. In pACTRLM1, the transcriptional activation domain of Gal4 is fused at the NH2 terminus of Rlm1. The MKK1 and MKK1P386 coding sequences were amplified by PCR using a 5 primer (5 -TTCTCGAGTATGGCTTCACTGTTCAGAC-3 ) incorporating an XhoI site and a 3 primer (5 -CCTCTAGATTAATCTTTCCAGC ACTT-3 ) incorporating an XbaI site. PCR amplification generated 1.5-kb fragments that were digested with XhoI and XbaI and inserted into the XhoI-XbaI gap of pNV7s (41) to generate pNV7-MKK1 and pNV7-MKK1P386. The 3.0-kb SalI-EcoRI fragment containing the GAL1p-MKK1P386 construct of pNV7MKK1P386 was cloned into the SalI-EcoRI gap of YEplac112 and YIplac204 to generate pNV7W-MKK1P386 and YIpGAL-MKK1P386, respectively. A TRP1based integration plasmid, YIpGAL-MKK1P386, was used for its integration by homologous recombination at the trp1 locus in wild-type strain 1783. Isolation of rlm mutations.

at a higher temperature (38 C), cells of wild-type strain 1783 carrying pNV7MKK1P386 were streaked out on SG-Ura plates containing 1 M sorbitol and incubated at 25 C. A total of 25 colonies grew in the presence of galactose, and these candidates were screened for temperature sensitivity (Ts ) by replica plating to YEPD and YEPD containing 1 M sorbitol then incubation at 38 C. Nine of them did not grow at 38 C on YEPD alone but grew on YEPD containing 1 M sorbitol. These nine mutants were then each transformed with YCpMPK1 to test whether the Ts phenotype was rescued by the MPK1 gene. Cloning of RLM1 and RSP5. Strains GMY61-1A and GMY62-3C were transformed with a YCp50 yeast genomic library (49) at 25 C and then replica plated to YEPD medium at 38 C. After 2 days of incubation, two transformant clones gave confluent growth. Two plasmids (pYW14 and pYW52) that rescue the Ts phenotype were recovered from S. cerevisiae by transforming E. coli. They contained different genomic DNA inserts, as determined by restriction site mapping (see Fig. 4). The nucleotide sequences of the 4.4-kb PstI-HindIII region of pYW14 and the 1.0-kb BamHI fragment of pYW52 were determined for both strands by the dideoxy-chain termination technique (53). Construction of yeast strains with RLM1 or RSP5 deletions. Deletion alleles of RLM1 and RSP5 were constructed by the one-step gene replacement method (see Fig. 4) (51). The 2.1-kb AccI-SnaBI fragment of RLM1 was replaced with the 1.6-kb SmaI-SalI fragment of LEU2 or the 0.9-kb SalI-SmaI fragment of TRP1, and the 1.0-kb BamHI fragment of RSP5 was replaced with the 1.1-kb BamHI fragment of URA3, after appropriate conversion of restriction sites. These constructions were made separately in the vector pBluescript SK carrying the 5.8-kb PstI fragment of RLM1 or the 4.9-kb SalI-SphI fragment of RSP5, respectively. The DNAs containing the entire rlm1 ::LEU2, rlm1 ::TRP1, and rsp5 ::URA3 constructions were used to transform diploid strains 1788 and 15Du by selection for Leu , Trp , or Ura . Restriction mapping and Southern analysis of genomic DNAs from the resulting transformants were conducted to confirm that transplacement had occurred at each locus. In the case of rlm1 ::LEU2, we confirmed that the caffeine-sensitive phenotype caused by the rlm1 ::LEU2 mutation was suppressed by YCpG33-RLM1 in a galactose-dependent manner. Assessment of cell lysis. Qualitative assessment of lysis of the cells in colonies was done by an alkaline phosphatase assay as described by Cabib and Duran (5). Cells were spotted onto YEPD agar plates, incubated at 25 C, and then shifted overnight to 38 C. The plates were then overlaid with an alkaline phosphatase assay solution containing 0.05 M glycine hydrochloride (pH 9.5), 1% agar, and 10 mM chromogenic substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate. Colonies which contained lysed cells stained blue, whereas intact colonies remained white. RNA (Northern) blot analysis. RNAs were prepared from exponentially growing wild-type (GMY63-5B) and rlm1 ::LEU2 (GMY63-5D) cells, separated in an agarose gel containing formaldehyde, and blotted as described previously (13). RNA samples were split into two aliquots and probed for MPK1 and ACT1. RNA was quantitated by densitometric analysis. MPK1 RNA levels were normalized by determining the ratio of MPK1 RNA to ACT1 RNA. Two-hybrid and -galactosidase assays. To create an in-frame protein fusion between LexA and Rlm1, the 2.6-kb BglII-PstI fragment of pACT-RLM1 containing the full-length coding sequence was cloned into the BamHI-SalI gap of pBTM116 (62) to generate pYW61. The LexA-Rlm1 fusion protein strongly activated transcription of HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes containing LexA operators in the reporter strain L40 (62). Then, plasmid pYW62 was constructed by removing the 1-kb ClaI-ClaI fragment from pYW61. pYW62 expresses LexARlm1 C, a LexA-Rlm1 fusion protein lacking the COOH-terminal 151 amino acids. The LexA-Rlm1 C fusion protein moderately activated expression of reporter genes, but histidine auxotrophy of transformants with pYW62 could be obtained by growing cells in the presence of 100 mM 3-aminotriazole, a chemical inhibitor of the HIS3 gene product, imidazole glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase. pB331 (kindly provided by M. Snyder) (10) expresses a fusion protein between an activation domain of Gal4 and the full-length coding sequence of the SLT2/MPK1 gene. Two-hybrid and -galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (13, 18, 62). Nucleotide sequence accession number. The GenBank/EMBL accession number for RLM1 is D63340.

FIG. 1. Effect of overexpression of MKK1P386 on cellular growth. (A) Wildtype cells (strain 1788) carrying pNV7-MKK1 (MKK1) or pNV7-MKK1P386 (MKK1P386) were streaked onto SD-Ura (Glu) or SG-Ura containing 2% galactose (Gal). Plates were incubated for 3 days at 30 C. (B) Wild-type cells and mpk1 cells transformed with pNV7s (Control) or pNV7-MKK1P386 (GAL1pMKK1P386) were patched onto SG-Ura supplemented with 1 M sorbitol. bck1 cells transformed with YCplac22 (Control) or pNV7W-MKK1P386 (GAL1pMKK1P386) were patched onto SG-Trp supplemented with 1 M sorbitol. Plates were incubated for 3 days at 35 C. Each patch represents an independent transformant. Strains: wild type, 1788; mpk1 , DL456; bck1 , DL251.

strains, including 15Dau, 1783, and W303-1A, cell growth was strongly inhibited in the presence of galactose (Fig. 1A), indicating that induced overproduction of the MKK1P386 gene was toxic. This growth-inhibitory effect was more severe when cells were grown at a higher temperature or in the presence of sorbitol. If a growth-inhibitory effect of the overexpressed MKK1P386 gene by the inducible GAL1 promoter is caused by hyperactivation of the Mpk1 pathway, this toxicity might be rescued by mutations in MPK1 but not in BCK1. To examine this possibility, we tested the effects of mutations in MPK1 and BCK1. Deletion of MPK1 or BCK1 results in failure to form colonies at an elevated temperature, a phenotype that can be suppressed by the addition of 1 M sorbitol to the medium. Plasmids pNV7-MKK1P386 and pNV7W-MKK1P386 were transformed into mpk1 (DL456) and bck1 (DL251) strains, respectively, and transformants were tested for growth on galactose medium containing 1 M sorbitol to allow mpk1 and bck1 mutants to grow. The mpk1 mutation relieved toxicity, whereas the bck1 mutation did not (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that inhibition of cell growth by MKK1P386 overexpression requires Mpk1 activity. In other words, hyperactivation of the Mpk1 pathway is toxic to yeast cells. The bck1 mutant allowed a greater degree of residual growth upon MKK1P386 overexpression than did the wild-type strain (Fig. 1B). One explanation for this result is that the level of Mkk1P386 activity may be lower in bck1 strains than in BCK1 strains. To examine the effects of MKK1P386 overexpression on growth, we constructed strain GMI1783, which carries a GAL1p-MKK1P386 construct integrated at the trp1 locus of the wild-type strain, 1783. Strains 1783 and GMI1783 were grown in raffinose-containing medium (YEPR) and then shifted to galactose-containing medium (YEPG). The induced expression of MKK1P386 caused growth arrest after 6 h in galactose. While cells did not exhibit cell cycle stage-specific growth ar-

RESULTS Effect of MKK1P386 overexpression. A gain-of-function mutation of MKK1, MKK1P386, was previously identified by a screen for spontaneous MKK1 mutations that suppress the cell lysis phenotype associated with loss of PKC1 function (65). This mutation also suppresses the bck1 mutation, indicating that MKK1P386 constitutively activates the pathway even in the absence of upstream components. We constructed a plasmid, pNV7-MKK1P386, containing GAL1p-MKK1P386, in which the expression of MKK1P386 is under the control of the strong GAL1 promoter. Thus, overexpression of MKK1P386 can be achieved by inducing GAL1p-MKK1P386 with the addition of galactose. When this plasmid was introduced into a variety of

rest, MKK1P386 overexpression did induce morphological changes such as elongated buds and multiple buds (data not shown). Isolation of MKK1P386 overexpression-resistant mutants. To search for genes that interact with the Mpk1 pathway, we carried out a screen to isolate mutations which suppress the growth-inhibitory effect of MKK1P386 overexpression and simultaneously confer sorbitol-dependent growth at a higher temperature (38 C), because mutations in the Mpk1 pathway were expected to result in a temperature-dependent cell lysis defect. It seemed probable that mutations identified by this screen might affect components acting downstream of Mkk1. Cells of strain 1783 carrying plasmid pNV7-MKK1P386 (GAL1p-MKK1P386) were streaked on galactose-containing plates and incubated at 25 C. Colonies that grew in the presence of galactose were screened for temperature sensitivity as described in Materials and Methods. We isolated nine suppressor mutants that were Ts for growth at 38 C but were rescued by 1 M sorbitol (see Materials and Methods). We expected to find mpk1 mutants among them. Indeed, the Ts phenotype of seven mutants was efficiently rescued by the MPK1 gene on a low-copy-number plasmid, suggesting that they may represent mutations in MPK1. We further characterized the remaining two mutants. We carried out several experiments to address the possibility that the GAL1p-MKK1P386 suppression was due to mutations affecting galactose induction per se. Plasmid-free descendants of the primary yeast mutant isolates were retransformed with pNV7-MKK1P386 and with pYS91 carrying ACT1 fused to the GAL1 promoter. Overexpression of ACT1 is known to cause lethality (33). Transformants of each primary isolate with each plasmid were tested for growth on galactose-containing medium. They once again suppressed the toxic phenotype of MKK1P386 overexpression but did not suppress that of ACT1 (data not shown). Furthermore, transformation of a plasmid carrying lacZ fused to the GAL7 promoter into mutants showed no effect on expression of -galactosidase in the presence of galactose (data not shown). Thus, these strains bore host mutations that resulted in resistance to MKK1P386 overexpression, and their effects were not related to control of transcription from the GAL1 promoter. The two mutants, GMR14 and GMR52, carrying pNV7MKK1P386 were crossed with the wild-type strain 15D u, and the resulting diploid cells were examined. Each of the heterozygous diploids failed to grow in the presence of galactose and grew on YEPD at 38 C. Thus, both mutants were recessive for both phenotypes. We analyzed segregants from a cross between strains GMR14 carrying pNV7-MKK1P386 and 15D u (Fig. 2A). In this cross, analysis of the tetrad sets in which all four segregants carried the GAL1p-MKK1P386 plasmid revealed a 2 :2 segregation for growth on galactosecontaining medium in at least 10 tetrads, suggesting that a single mutation was responsible for the resistance to growth inhibition of MKK1P386 overexpression. The suppressor locus was designated rlm1 (for resistance to lethality of MKK1P386 overexpression). The rlm1 single mutation suppressed not only growth inhibition but also morphological changes caused by overexpression of MKK1P386 (data not shown). In contrast, Ts :Ts segregated as a mixture of 4 :0 3 :1 , and 2 :2 tetrads, indicating that two mutations were required for the Ts phenotype (Fig. 2A). All Ts segregants were suppressed by the addition of sorbitol to the media and were resistant to the toxicity by MKK1P386 overexpression, indicating that a combination of the rlm1 mutation with another mutation is necessary to produce the Ts phenotype. In other words, the rlm1 mutation is lethal at 38 C only in combination with a

(A) GMR14 (rlm1-1 rlt1-1) carrying pNV7-MKK1P386 (GAL1p-MKK1P386) was crossed with the wildtype strain 15D u; the resulting diploid was sporulated, and then tetrads were dissected. The spores were allowed to germinate at 25 C and transferred to SG-Ura containing 1 M sorbitol at 35 C (left), YEPD at 38 C (middle), or YEPD supplemented with 1 M sorbitol at 38 C (right). Each row of cells was derived from one tetrad. (B) GMY61-1A (rlm1-1 rlt1-1) carrying pNV7W-MKK1P386 was transformed with YCp33, pYW14-6 (RLM1), or pYW52-3 (RSP5).

second mutation, which was tentatively designated rlt1 (for rlm1-associated Ts ). Complementation data indicated that the GMR52 mutant also contained the mutations in the RLM1 and RLT1 genes. Isolation of genes by complementation. In an attempt to clone the RLM1 and RLT1 genes, we transformed the rlm1 rlt1 mutants GMY61-1A and GMY62-3C with plasmid DNA from a YCp50-based yeast genomic library. Approximately 10,000 independent transformants were screened for complementation of the Ts phenotype of rlm1 rlt1 cells, and two plasmids (pYW14 and pYW52) were obtained (see Materials and Methods). Restriction fragment analysis of the plasmids indicated that they contained different inserts (Fig. 3). Consistent with the physical differences between the two plasmids, pYW14 restored the growth inhibition of MKK1P386 overexpression

and complemented the Ts growth defect, whereas pYW52 complemented the Ts phenotype but failed to restore the toxicity of MKK1P386 overexpression (Fig. 2B). Thus, by both physical and phenotypic analyses, these two plasmids defined two genes. pYW14 and pYW52 plasmids contain RLM1 itself and a suppressor of rlm1 rlt1, respectively (see below). RLM1 encodes an SRF-like protein. The essential region of plasmid pYW14 was determined by analysis of subclones (Fig. 3A). The smallest restriction endonuclease fragment capable of complementing the Ts phenotype of rlm1 rlt1 cells was able to restore the growth inhibition of MKK1P386 overexpression. The nucleotide sequence of the 4.4-kb PstI-HindIII region was determined. An open reading frame that predicts a protein of 676 amino acids was found (Fig. 4). The predicted protein sequence of Rlm1 was compared with those in GenBank and EMBL data banks, using the FASTA program (45). The N-terminal 80-amino-acid region of Rlm1 is homologous to the DNA-binding and dimerization domain of SRF-related proteins (46, 59) (Fig. 5). This region of similarity places the Rlm1 protein in the MADS box family of transcription factors, named for Mcm1 (which regulates transcription of many genes in S. cerevisiae (2, 44), Agamous and Deficiens (which function as homeotic gene products in plants) (54, 56), and SRF (which confers serum responsiveness and muscle specificity to several genes) (42). In all MADS box proteins, 16 of the first 50 amino acids in the MADS box domain are invariant (Fig. 5). This region of Rlm1 is more similar to that of the myocyte enhancer factor family implicated in the regulation of muscle transcription in vertebrates (6) (70% identical) than to the corresponding region of other MADS box proteins (38 to 56% identical). The strongly conserved N terminus of the domain is rich in polar and basic residues, reminiscent of DNA-binding domains. The basic region has two segments of predicted helix. The more divergent C-terminal half of the domain is largely hydrophobic (Fig. 5). Outside the first 80 amino acids, Rlm1 shows no significant homology to MADS box family, and the protein is rich in serine and threonine residues (24% in 595 amino acids). Immediately following the MADS box domain of Rlm1 are 14 amino acids, of which 11 are either aspartate or glutamate. In addition, there is a distinctive sequence of consecutive asparagine beginning at amino acid position 567 (Fig. 4).

Disruption of RLM1. Strains with mutations in the Mpk1 pathway exhibit a variety of defects in growth control. Deletions of BCK1, MKK1 and MKK2, or MPK1 confer the following phenotypes: (i) failure to grow at elevated temperatures, which can be suppressed by the addition of 1 M sorbitol to the medium; (ii) sensitivity to low levels of caffeine in the medium; (iii) failure to grow on glycerol medium; and (iv) sensitivity to nitrogen starvation (9, 11, 26, 30, 31, 37, 38). To examine the phenotypic defect associated with loss of RLM1 function and to determine whether RLM1 participates in the same cellular processes as BCK1, MKK1/MKK2, and MPK1, a deletion mutant of RLM1 was constructed in vitro. A 2.1-kb AccI-SnaBI fragment encompassing the RLM1 open reading frame was replaced with the S. cerevisiae LEU2 gene (Fig. 3A) (see Materials and Methods). The deletion allele (rlm1 ::LEU2) was introduced into wildtype diploid yeast strains 1788 and 15Du. Transformants were tested for possession of the deletion allele by Southern blot analysis (data not shown). Heterozygous diploid transformants were sporulated, and progeny from individual tetrads were dissected onto plates and analyzed. Four spores from each tetrad gave rise to colonies. Unlike Mpk1 pathway mutants, the rlm1 ::LEU2 segregants grew normally at all temperatures ranging from 14 to 38 C. When the rlm1 ::LEU2 segregants derived from 1788 and 15Du were crossed with the rlm1-1 rlt1-1 strain (GMY61-1A), tetrad dissection revealed a 2 :2 segregation for growth on YEPD medium at 38 C in all 23 tetrads. This result confirmed that the complementing plasmid pYW14 carries the RLM1 gene. The Ts phenotype was suppressed by the addition of 1 M sorbitol to the medium, as observed for bck1 , mkk1 mkk2 , and mpk1 mutants. Microscopic examination of rlm1 rlt1 mutants revealed a high frequency (66 to 80%) of nonrefractile ghosts at 38 C. Furthermore, an alkaline phosphatase assay on YEPD agar plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (5, 43) showed that rlm1 rlt1 mutants turned blue at 38 C. These results indicated that cell lysis was occurring at the high temperature. The rlm1 ::LEU2 mutants grew on glycerol medium and were not sensitive to nitrogen starvation. However, the rlm1 ::LEU2 mutation enhanced caffeine sensitivity (Fig. 6). The rlm1 ::LEU2 mutant was more sensitive than the wildtype strain, but its sensitive phenotype was not as severe as that of mpk1 ::TRP1 cells. The rlm1 ::LEU2 rlt1-1 double mutant was more sensitive than rlm1 ::LEU2, suggesting that the rlt1 mutation influences the severity of the rlm1 phenotype. The caffeine-sensitive phenotype of rlm1 ::LEU2 and rlm1 :: LEU2 rlt1-1 cells was suppressed by the addition of 1 M sorbitol medium, as observed for bck1 and mpk1 mutants. The

FIG. 7. Effect of the Gal4-Rlm1 fusion protein. (A) Gal4-Rlm1 fusion construct. The GAD (residues 768 to 881) was fused to residues 1 to 676 of Rlm1. This construct was driven by the ADH1 promoter. (B) Cells were transformed with YEp181-RLM1 or YEp195-RLM1 (YEpRLM1), pACTII (vector), or pACT-RLM1 (Gal4-Rlm1), and then transformants were streaked onto YEPD at 35 C or YEPD containing 2 mM caffeine at 25 C. Strains: bck1 , DL251; mpk1 , DL456.

caffeine sensitivity of rlm1 and mpk1 cells was not additive in the double mutant relative to single mutants (data not shown), suggesting that Rlm1 operates in the Mpk1 pathway. One explanation for the ability of rlm1 to suppress the growth-inhibitory effect of Mkk1P386 overproduction is that the rlm1 ::LEU2 mutation would have a negative effect on the expression MPK1, thereby reducing the toxicity of Mkk1P386 overproduction. To address this possibility, MPK1 RNA levels in wild-type and rlm1 ::LEU2 strains were examined by RNA blot analysis (data not shown). Quantitative comparison of MPK1 RNA levels revealed that the rlm1 ::LEU2 mutation did not affect MPK1 transcript levels. Genetic evidence suggests that RLM1 functions in the Mpk1 MAPK pathway. So far, our experiments demonstrated that Rlm1 is needed for the toxicity caused by MKK1P386 overexpression. They did not clarify whether the requirement for Rlm1 reflected its direct involvement as a downstream component of the Mpk1 pathway. This possibility was examined by genetic tests. We tested the effect of RLM1 overexpression on the phenotypes caused by bck1 and mpk1 mutations. As shown in Fig. 7B, multiple copies of the RLM1 gene failed to suppress the Ts growth defect of bck1 and mpk1 cells and the inhibition of growth by caffeine. Overexpression of RLM1 driven from the GAL1 promoter was also unable to suppress bck1 and mpk1 (data not shown). In most cases, MADS box proteins such as SRF and the SRF-related yeast protein Mcm1 seem to be able to bind promoter DNA but unable to activate transcription without an appropriate protein partner (12). If Rlm1 were also involved in the activation of transcription in the Mpk1 pathway by recruiting a regulated TCF, one might expect that overexpression of Rlm1 would be unable to suppress bck1 and mpk1 . To test this possibility, we constructed a fusion, in which Rlm1 was directly connected to a strong Gal4 transcriptional activator domain (GAD), whose expression was expressed by the ADH1 promoter (Fig. 7A). Such a partner-independent Rlm1 fusion

FIG. 8. Two-hybrid interaction between Mpk1 and Rlm1. The reporter strain L40 (LYS2::lexA-HIS3 URA3::lexA-lacZ) was transformed with various plasmids as indicated. Approximately 3 105 cells of each transformant were spotted onto SC-His medium containing 100 mM 3-aminotriazole (AT). Plates were incubated at 30 C for 4 days. Transformants were assayed for -galactosidase activity as described previously (13). Plasmids: LexA, pBTM116; LexA-RLM1 C, pYW62; GAD, pACTII; GAD-MPK1, pB331. -Galactosidase activity is expressed in units.

variant should now stimulate transcription without activation by Mpk1, resulting in suppression of the bck1 and mpk1 mutations. As shown in Fig. 7B, the Gal4-Rlm1 fusion protein partially suppressed the Ts growth defect and caffeine-sensitive phenotypes of bck1 and mpk1 cells. Furthermore, Gal4Rlm1 also suppressed the failure of cells to grow on glycerol medium and the nitrogen starvation sensitivity of these mutants (data not shown). Thus, the Rlm1 fusion protein carrying the GAD suppresses all defects of bck1 and mpk1 cells. These genetic tests indicate that Rlm1 functions in the same pathway as Bck1 and Mpk1 and that Rlm1 operates downstream of Mpk1 in the pathway. Therefore, Rlm1 appears to play a role in the transcriptional events controlled by the Mpk1 MAPK. Rlm1 and Mpk1 interact in the two-hybrid system. Genetic analysis suggests that Rlm1 is a downstream component of the Mpk1 pathway. A possible interaction between Mpk1 and Rlm1 was analyzed with the yeast two-hybrid system, which allows the detection of protein-protein interactions in vivo (18). Mpk1 was fused to the GAD (10). A truncated form of Rlm1 (Rlm1 C) lacking the COOH-terminal 151 amino acids was fused to the DNA-binding domain of LexA (see Materials and Methods). These proteins were analyzed, singly or in combination, for the ability to activate transcription of HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes containing LexA operators (Fig. 8). Expression of the LexA-Rlm1 C fusion, in the absence of a GAD fusion, yielded a relatively high background of expression of reporter genes. Nevertheless, stimulation over this background was observed when the GAD-Mpk1 fusion was coexpressed. Measurement of the level of -galactosidase induced indicated that this signal was around 10-fold higher than the background level of -galactosidase expression. This finding suggests that Mpk1 and Rlm1 interact in vivo, supporting the possibility that Rlm1 functions in the Mpk1 pathway. RSP5 is an extra-copy suppressor of rlm1 rlt1. By subcloning and complementation analyses, the ability of plasmid pYW52 to complement the Ts phenotype was localized to the 4.9-kb SalI-SphI fragment (Fig. 3B). Determination of the DNA sequence of the 1-kb BamHI fragment revealed that this DNA fragment is identical to the sequence of RSP5 (accession number L1119 [63a]). The RSP5 gene was identified as a suppressor mutation of the spt3 mutations (64) and encodes a protein of 809 amino acid residues. At the C-terminal 400 amino acids, Rsp5 has sequence similarity to oncogene product E6-AP, which appears to be involved in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. In fact, recent biochemical studies showed that the Rsp5 protein has a ubiquitin-protein ligase activity (25).

To determine the phenotypic consequences of loss of RSP5 function, a deletion mutant of RSP5 was constructed as described in Materials and Methods. A 1.0-kb fragment of RSP5 was replaced with the selectable marker URA3 (Fig. 3B). This deletion allele (rsp5 ::URA3) was transplaced into a diploid strain (15Du) by selecting for URA . Southern blot analysis of chromosomal DNA from transformants confirmed that the resulting diploid was heterozygous for the wild-type and disrupted rsp5 (rsp5 ::URA3) alleles. Sporulation and tetrad analysis of this diploid showed that only two of the four spores per tetrad were viable at 30 C on rich YEPD medium. All viable spores were Ura , indicating that the inviable spores contain the rsp5 ::URA3 replacement. These results show that RSP5 is essential. Addition of 1 M sorbitol to the medium did not support the growth of rsp5 ::URA3 cells. The cloned insert in plasmid pYW52 could represent either the actual rlt1 locus or a suppressor locus. To distinguish between these possibilities, we crossed the rlm1 ::LEU2 rlt1-1 strain (GMY67-5A) with the rlm1 ::LEU2 rsp5 ::URA3 strain (GMY68-3A) carrying plasmid pYW52-4. Plasmid pYW52-4 was cured from the resulting diploid. Because this diploid is heterozygous for the rlt1-1 mutation, a disruption of the RSP5 gene should unmask the Ts phenotype if the cloned fragment is exclusively RLT1 coding sequence. However, the diploid grew at 38 C. After sporulation and tetrad dissection of the diploid at 25 C, the viability of the spores was assessed. Only half of the spores were viable; as expected, all of these were Ura , but some segregants were Ts . These results demonstrate that RSP5 at low copy number suppresses the Ts growth defect of rlm1 rlt1 cells. RLT1 is identical to SSD1/SRK1. Several mutants of the Pkc1-Mpk1 pathway have been shown to be synthetically lethal with ssd1/srk1 (9, 30). Thus, loss of SSD1 function enhances the phenotypes associated with the Mpk1 pathway mutants. The SSD1 gene is predicted to encode a protein related to the Dis3 protein of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which has been implicated in protein phosphatase function (58, 63). In view of these facts, we explored the possibility that rlt1 was allelic to ssd1. To determine the phenotypic effect of loss of both RLM1 and SSD1, the ssd1 ::URA3 strain (KA31-2A-2) (61) was crossed to a strain (GMY63-5C) containing the rlm1 ::LEU2 mutation. rlm1 ::LEU2 ssd1 ::URA3 segregants were observed at the expected frequency. Strain KA31-2A-2 grew normally over a range of temperatures and was not sensitive to caffeine (at 10 mM), whereas double mutants exhibited the various defects observed in mutants of the Mpk1 pathway, including the inability to grow at 38 C, inhibition of growth by caffeine (at 5 mM), failure to grow on glycerol medium, and sensitivity to nitrogen starvation (data not shown). The Ts growth defect and caffeine-sensitive phenotypes were suppressed by the addition of 1 M sorbitol to the medium. Thus, the ssd1 mutation enhanced the severity of the rlm1 phenotype, as observed for rlm1 rlt1 mutants. To determine whether rlt1 is allelic with ssd1, the rlm1 ::TRP1 rlt1-1 strain (GMY70-10B) was crossed to the rlm1 ::LEU2 ssd1 ::URA3 strain (GMY72-1B), and segregation analysis was conducted on the resulting diploid strain. The diploid was Ts for growth at 38 C and exhibited caffeine sensitivity. Tetrad dissection revealed a 0 :4 segregation for growth on YEPD at 38 C and growth on YEPD containing 5 mM caffeine in all 11 tetrads. These results indicate tight linkage of rlt1 to ssd1, suggesting that RLT1 is identical to SSD1. Overexpression of MSG5 suppresses the Mkk1P386 overproduction toxicity. To identify additional components of the Mpk1 pathway, we carried out a screen to isolate genes which, when overexpressed from multicopy plasmids, are capable of

suppressing the growth-inhibitory effect of MKK1P386 overexpression. It seemed probable that genes identified by this screen would encode proteins which negatively regulate the Mpk1 pathway. The selection was performed by using a yeast genomic library cloned in the multicopy vector YEp13 (contains S. cerevisiae LEU2; provided by Y. Ohya). The library was transformed into strain GMI1783, which carries a GAL1pMKK1P386 construct integrated at the trp1 locus. A total of 4,000 Leu transformants were obtained and subsequently screened for the ability to grow in the presence of galactose. Seventeen transformants were capable of forming colonies on galactose-containing medium. The suppressing plasmids were recovered in E. coli and shown to rescue the GAL1p-MKK1P386 phenotype when reintroduced into GM1783 cells (Fig. 9B). Of the 17 candidates, 10 clones did not suppress the toxic phenotype of ACT1 overexpression under the control of the GAL1 promoter, indicating that their effects were not related to control of transcription from the GAL1 promoter. The 10 plasmids contained identical restriction fragments (Fig. 9A). Sequence analysis of subclones containing the suppressing activity revealed that this DNA fragment is identical in sequence to MSG5. The MSG5 gene was identified as a multicopy suppressor of growth arrest caused by a gpa1 mutation (13). MSG5 encodes a dual-specificity protein phosphatase that dephosphorylates and inactivates Fus3 MAPK acting in the mating pheromone signal transduction (13). Therefore, our results suggest that overexpression of MSG5 suppresses the toxic effect caused by hyperactivation of the Mpk1 pathway by dephosphorylating and inactivating Mpk1 MAPK. Thus, Msg5 phosphatase appears to act on Mpk1 under overexpressed conditions. DISCUSSION In this study, a screen for suppressor mutations of the growth inhibition caused by an activated mutation of MKK1 was used to identify downstream components of the Mpk1 pathway. While overexpression of an activated form of protein kinase can sometime be nonspecifically toxic, the growth-inhibitory effect of MKK1P386 overexpression appeared to be specific, in as much as it was suppressed by the disruption of MPK1, which functions downstream of MKK1, but not by the disruption of BCK1, which functions upstream of MKK1. These results suggest that overexpression of MKK1P386 causes toxicity

through the hyperactivation of the Mpk1 kinase and consequent excessive phosphorylation of target(s) of Mpk1. According to this hypothesis, mutations in a component that functions downstream of Mpk1 will relieve the inhibition caused by MKK1P386 overexpression. On the basis of this assumption, we selected mutations that relieved inhibition. Our selection yielded mutations in a new gene, termed RLM1. Genetic and phenotypic analysis suggests that Rlm1 is a downstream component of the Mpk1 pathway. The RLM1 gene potentially encodes a protein belonging to the MADS box family of transcription factors. The MADS box motif is found in several regulatory proteins, including S. cerevisiae Mcm1 (2, 44) and Arg80 (15, 16), human SRF (42), human proteins that bind muscle control elements and growth factor-regulated genes (6), and the plant homeotic gene products Deficiens and Agamous (54, 56). As a member of the MADS box family, the Rlm1 protein is predicted to regulate the expression of a target gene(s) in response to Pkc1-Mpk1 signaling. The DNA-binding properties of MADS box proteins as homo- or heterodimers have been demonstrated for SRF and Mcm1 (8, 39, 42, 46). The N-terminal basic part (first 30 amino acids) of the MADS box domains within these proteins mediates the sequence specificity of DNA binding, while the divergent C-terminal portion directs dimerization and interaction with coregulators. Mcm1 controls the expression of a number of different genes by recruiting specific transcription regulatory proteins: 1 to activate -cell-type-specific gene expression, 2 to repress a-cell-type-specific gene expression, and Ste12 to activate pheromone-dependent expression of a-cell-type-specific genes (22). SRF is essential for the serum-inducible transcriptional activation of the c-fos nuclear proto-oncogene of mammals. At the serum response element of c-fos, SRF can form a ternary complex with another protein, p62TCF, which by itself exhibits no detectable DNA-binding activity (60). Thus, Mcm1 and SRF recruit additional factors to regulate gene expression. It is tempting to speculate that, in analogy to Mcm1 and SRF, Rlm1 may be able to recruit a ternary complex factor(s). In mammalian cells, activation of the MAPK pathway by growth factor signals leads to phosphorylation of the SRF accessory factor TCF/Elk-1 and activation of transcription (23, 60). This pathway has several parallels to gene induction in the pheromone signaling pathway of S. cerevisiae. Pheromone also activates the MAPK pathway that activates transcription factor Ste12 by phosphorylating it (17). Ste12, often in association with Mcm1, then activates transcription (22). By analogy with the MAPK pathways regulating mammalian SRF­Elk-1 and yeast Mcm1-Ste12, it seems reasonable to speculate that the Mpk1 MAPK pathway may phosphorylate a transcription factor analogous to Elk-1 and Ste12, which activates transcription by association with Rlm1. It would likewise be interesting to determine whether proteins that interact with Rlm1 exist. Since a mammalian gene encoding TCF/SAP-1 was isolated by using the yeast system (12), yeast genes encoding the proteins interacting with Rlm1 may be represented in a cDNA collection obtained by two-hybrid screening. Although overexpression of RLM1 was unable to suppress the mpk1 mutation, the fusion of Rlm1 to the Gal4 activator domain caused suppression of the phenotypes of mpk1 . We suggest two possible explanations for this observation. The activity of Rlm is activated by the Mpk1 pathway, and the Rlm1 fusion protein carrying the GAD is active independently of the Mpk1 pathway. Alternatively, Rlm1 associates with an accessory protein, which is activated by the Mpk1 pathway and functions as an activator of Rlm1. Such a partner-independent

Rlm1 fusion variant is active without activation of the Mpk1 pathway. In either case, the Gal4-tagged derivative of Rlm1 is expected to be constitutively active. Hyperactivation of the Mpk1 pathway by MKK1P386 overexpression caused growth arrest associated with morphological alterations, whereas wildtype cells expressing the Gal4-Rlm1 fusion protein grew normally but morphological alterations were slightly induced (data not shown). Therefore, the activity of Gal4-Rlm1 may be lower than that of Rlm1 activated by the Mpk1 pathway. Yeast strains with mutations in the Mpk1 pathway display the following phenotypes (9, 11, 26, 30, 31, 37, 38): caffeine sensitivity, a temperature-dependent cell lysis defect, glycerol growth defect, and starvation sensitivity. rlm1 mutants display a caffeine-sensitive phenotype, but this sensitivity is not as severe as that of bck1 or mpk1 cells. Unlike Mpk1 pathway mutants, the rlm1 cells grow normally at any temperature, grow on glycerol medium, and are not sensitive to nitrogen starvation. One possible explanation for this finding is that Rlm1 is an important downstream component of the Mpk1 pathway, but additional Rlm1-like proteins that prevent rlm1 cells from acquiring the growth defects may be present. Precedent exists for such a situation in the Mpk1 pathway. For example, there are two sets of functionally redundant genes, MKK1/MKK2 and NHP6A/NHP6B (10, 26). This model posits that partial loss of activity of downstream components by the rlm1 mutation is enough to cause resistance to the growthinhibitory effect caused by hyperactivation of the Mpk1 pathway. Consistent with this possibility, the Gal4-Rlm1 fusion protein suppressed not only caffeine sensitivity but also other growth defects of bck1 and mpk1 cells. S. cerevisiae has at least four separate MAPK activation pathways that mediate distinct responses to different extracellular or cell autonomous signals. The Hog1 MAPK pathway is involved in osmoregulation and regulated by an Sln1-Ssk1 twocomponent system (34). Disruption of SLN1 results in constitutive activation of the Hog1 pathway and lethality (34). Thus, hyperactivation of two different MAPKs, Mpk1 and Hog1, induces the growth-inhibitory effect. However, disruption of RLM1 did not suppress sln1 mutations (data not shown), suggesting that the causes for these toxic effects induced by hyperactivation of the Mpk1 and Hog1 pathways may be different. Overexpression of PTP2 was able to suppress growth defects caused by the sln1 mutation (34). This result raises the possibility that Ptp2 dephosphorylates phosphotyrosine of the Hog1 MAPK, resulting in its inactivation. Previously, we identified Msg5 as a dual-specificity phosphatase that acts on Fus3 (13). In addition, Msg5 is likely to act on Mpk1, because overexpression of MSG5 suppressed the growth-inhibitory effect of MKK1P386 overexpression. In contrast, MSG5 overexpression failed to suppress the lethality of sln1 mutations (14). Therefore, Msg5 appears to act on Fus3 and Mpk1 but not on Hog1. Taken together, the data suggest that there are two separate types of MAPK phosphatases that have some specificity for MAPKs. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Y. Suzuki for help in some of the experiments.
