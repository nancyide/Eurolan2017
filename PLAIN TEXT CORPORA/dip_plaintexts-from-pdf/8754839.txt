To identify genes whose functions are linked to CDC42, we screened for (i) multicopy suppressors of a Ts cdc42 mutant, (ii) mutants that require multiple copies of CDC42 for survival, and (iii) mutations that display synthetic lethality with a partial-loss-of-function allele of CDC24, which encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Cdc42p. In all three screens, we identified a new gene, BEM4. Cells from which BEM4 was deleted were inviable at 37 C. These cells became unbudded, large, and round, consistent with a model in which Bem4p acts together with Cdc42p in polarity establishment and bud emergence. In some strains, the ability of CDC42 to serve as a multicopy suppressor of the Ts growth defect of bem4 cells required co-overexpression of Rho1p, which is an essential Rho-type GTPase necessary for cell wall integrity. This finding suggests that Bem4p also affects Rho1p function. Bem4p displayed two-hybrid interactions with Cdc42p, Rho1p, and two of the three other known yeast Rho-type GTPases, suggesting that Bem4p can interact with multiple Rho-type GTPases. Models for the role of Bem4p include that it serves as a chaperone or modulates the interaction of these GTPases with one or more of their targets or regulators.

During bud emergence in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the actin cytoskeleton becomes polarized toward a discrete site, where the transport of secretory vesicles is directed for bud growth (16). CDC42, CDC24, and BEM1 are implicated in the control of bud emergence: loss-of-function mutations in any of these genes lead to the loss of actin polarization and can cause cells to arrest without buds. Because secretion and entry into the nuclear division cycle are not blocked by these mutations, the mutant cells become large, round, and multinucleate (1, 3, 11, 13, 26, 47, 48). Cdc42p is a member of the Rho family of small GTPases (26). Such GTPases act as molecular switches, through a conformational change between their GTP-bound active and GDP-bound inactive forms. Their nucleotide-bound state is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), GTPaseactivating proteins (GAPs), and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) (5, 8). Cdc24p displays GEF activity toward Cdc42p (54). Mutations in CDC24 can be suppressed by overexpression of CDC42 and display synthetic lethality with mutations in CDC42 (2, 55), consistent with a model in which the action of Cdc24p on Cdc42p is important for bud

emergence. Cdc24p has also been linked to the SH3 domaincontaining protein Bem1p. In particular, Cdc24p binds to Bem1p, and cdc24 and bem1 mutations are synthetically lethal (38). In addition to Cdc42p, S. cerevisiae has at least four other Rho-type GTPases, Rho1p to Rho4p. Rho1p is essential for viability (33). Cells containing a Ts rho1 allele lyse at restrictive temperatures, suggesting that Rho1p is required for integrity of the plasma membrane and cell wall (40, 52). One of the downstream targets of Rho1p is Pkc1p, a protein kinase C homolog that is required for proper assembly of the cell wall (31, 32, 37). Rho3p is also important for normal morphogenesis (23, 35, 36). At nonpermissive temperatures, cells bearing Ts rho3 alleles fail to polarize actin, are defective in bud growth, and become large and round. These phenotypes suggest that Rho3p is required for the maintenance of cell polarity during bud growth (23). RHO2 and RHO4 are not essential, and cells that lack either one of these genes grow well at all temperatures (33, 35). In this paper, we report the discovery of the bud emergence gene BEM4, whose product appears to be a novel binding protein for Rho-type GTPases. MATERIALS AND METHODS Microbiological techniques.

Indiana and in Tokyo by the dideoxy method. Each strand was sequenced completely, and all sites used for subcloning were sequenced across. Deletion derivatives of plasmids for sequencing were constructed by the method of Henikoff (20), and a model 370A automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems) was used for the sequencing done in Tokyo. Strains and plasmids. Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. pBluescript KS was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, Calif.). YEp24 contains URA3 and the 2 m plasmid replication origin (2 m autonomously replicating sequence [ARS]) (7). The YEp24-based library (10) contains Sau3A fragments of yeast genomic DNA inserted into the BamHI site of YEp24. pPB102 (2) and pSRO2-3 (36) are genomic clones containing CDC42 from the YEp24-based library. pPB320, which contains CDC42, ADE3, LEU2, and 2 m ARS, was constructed by coinserting a 5-kb BamHI-SalI fragment containing ADE3 (30) and a 4-kb SalI-EcoRV fragment containing CDC42 from pPB102 into the BamHI-PvuII sites of pSL113 (4). pPB170, which contains CDC24, ADE3, LEU2, and 2 m ARS, was constructed by inserting a 5-kb XbaI-BamHI fragment containing CDC24 from plasmid YEp103(CDC24) (14) into the XbaIBamHI sites of pPB166 (38). YCp50 contains URA3, CEN4, and ARS1 (42). pPB527 is a genomic clone containing BEM4 from a YCp50-based library (42). pGYM50, pGYM149, pGYM241, and pGYM245 are BEM4-bearing isolates from the YEp24-based library (see Fig. 2). pGYM50-1 was constructed by removing the SalI-SalI fragment from pGYM50. To construct pGYM50-2, pGYM50 was digested with SmaI and BstXI and then religated after blunting the BstXI overhang, using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. pGYM50-3 was constructed by removing the 2.7-kb AflII-AflII fragment of pGYM50. pGYM50-4 was constructed by inserting the 2.7-kb AflII-AflII fragment from pGYM50 into the SmaI site of the URA3, 2 m ARS plasmid YEplac195 (17). pGYM50-5 and pGYM50-7 were made by inserting the 4.8-kb BEM4-bearing BglII-SalI fragment from pGYM50 into the BamHI-SalI sites of YEplac195 and into the BamHI-XhoI sites of pBluescript KS , respectively. To construct pGYM50-6, pGYM50-5 was digested with AflII and then religated after filling in the fourbase overhang, using Klenow fragment. pSRO4 is an original isolate from the YEp24-based library (36). YEpSRO4 was made by inserting the 5.5-kb SRO4bearing SmaI-SalI fragment into the SmaI-SalI sites of the TRP1, 2 m ARS plasmid YEplac112 (17). pOPR1 contains the RHO1 coding region under the control of the TDH3 promoter, TRP1, and 2 m ARS (36). Plasmids used for the two-hybrid assays are described below. Phage DM1.1.15 was created by inserting

the 0.4-kb SpeI-NruI fragment from upstream of BEM4 (see Fig. 2 and 3) in pPB527 into the XbaI-SmaI sites of M13mp19 (53). Construction of disruption alleles of BEM4. pGYM50-8, which contains bem4 -1::URA3, was constructed by replacing the 1.1-kb EcoRV fragment (see Fig. 2 and 3) of pGYM50-7 with the URA3-bearing 1.1-kb SmaI-SmaI fragment from pJJ242 (27). In bem4 -1::URA3, the sequence between codons 70 and 433 of BEM4 was removed. pPB1023, which contains bem4 -2::URA3, was constructed by inserting fragments into pBR322 (6) as follows: (i) the 0.4-kb HincIIEcoRI fragment from DM1.1.15 (in which the HincII and EcoRI sites are from the polylinker) was inserted into the SspI-EcoRI sites, (ii) a 0.7-kb HpaI-Sau3A fragment from the 3 end of BEM4 (see Fig. 2 and 3) from pPB527 was inserted into the EcoRV-BamHI sites, and (iii) a 1.2-kb HindIII-HindIII fragment containing URA3 from YIpURA3 (S. Lillie, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor) was inserted into the HindIII site. In bem4 -2::URA3, the DNA between 101 bp upstream of the start codon and 57 codons upstream of the stop codon of BEM4 was removed. For gene replacements, a 2.6-kb BstXI-PvuII fragment from pGYM50-8 and a 3-kb PvuI (from within pBR322 sequences)-BamHI (corresponding to the Sau3A site in Fig. 2 and 3) fragment from pPB1023 were used. In each case, the success of the transplacement into the yeast genome was confirmed by Southern analysis. Isolation of multicopy suppressors of the cdc42 defect. Ts cdc42-1 strain YMR420 containing YEpSRO4 was transformed with the YEp24-based genomic library and plated on SDCA Ade plates. After incubation at 25 C for 1 day followed by incubation at 37 C for 3 days, cells that could form visible colonies were isolated and cultured in SDCA Ade. To confirm the ability of the plasmids to suppress the cdc42 Ts growth defect, each plasmid was reintroduced at 25 C into YMR420 containing YEpSRO4. Transformants were streaked on SDCA Ade plates and incubated at 37 C for 2 days. Plasmids that carried CDC42 were identified by amplification of a 740-bp DNA fragment, using PCR (43) with the two convergent primers 5 -AAAAAAAGATCTTCCACAAAATGCAAA and 5 -GGGGGGGTCGACGGATGATCCTGGCGC (underlined sequences indicate extensions that were introduced to allow for more efficient restriction of the amplified fragment). Colony-sectoring assays. A previously described colony-sectoring assay (3) was used to identify mutants that required multiple copies of CDC42 for survival. This assay is based on the facts that ade2 mutants are red, ade2 ade3 mutants are white, and 2 m ARS-based plasmids typically are segregated imperfectly between mother cell and daughter cell. Thus, when grown on YPD (nonselective) medium, ade2 ade3 cells that contain the CDC42- and ADE3-bearing plasmid pPB320 form colonies that contain red and white sectors (Sect phenotype), derived from cells that had retained and those that had lost the plasmid, respectively. However, in mutants that need multiple copies of CDC42 for survival, only those cells that inherit the plasmid can proliferate, resulting in uniformly red colonies (Sect phenotype). To search for mutants, strains PY406 and PY407 were plated on YPD and mutagenized with UV irradiation to approximately 10% survival, and Sect colonies were isolated. To test for dominance of the Sect phenotype, mutants were crossed to Y382 or Y388. To test whether mutants required CDC42 itself (as opposed to some other gene on the plasmid, such as ADE3), representative members of each complementation group were transformed separately with the CDC42-bearing plasmid pPB102 and with the control plasmid YEp24 (selecting for Ura transformants). Those mutants that became Sect when transformed with pPB102 and remained Sect when transformed with YEp24 were judged to be CDC42 requiring. Representative members of each group were then mated to known Ts cdc42 and cdc24 mutants. The resulting diploids were cured of the plasmid at room temperature and then tested for the ability to grow at 37 C. To identify mutations that display synthetic lethality with cdc24, we used essentially the procedure just described, except that the cdc24-4 strains PY88 and PY92 (containing the CDC24- and ADE3-bearing plasmid pPB170) were used. To test whether the Sect mutants required CDC24 itself from plasmid pPB170 for survival, we assayed the sectoring abilities of mutants after transformation with YEp103(CDC24) or with YEp24. Isolation of multicopy suppressors of the bem4 defect. bem4 -1::HIS3 strain GYM5-11 was transformed with the YEp24-based library and plated on SDCAU plates. After incubation at 37 C for 4 to 6 days, cells from visible colonies were isolated and cultured in SDCA-U. Plasmids were recovered and reintroduced into GYM5-11 to confirm the ability to suppress the bem4 Ts phenotype. Suppressing plasmids were classified by restriction analysis. Plasmids containing MSB1 (3) were identified by PCR using the following two sets of convergent primers, which were designed to amplify two distinct regions in MSB1: (i) 5 AGTATGGATGACGAAGAG and 5 -TTTTAAGCTTTTCGGATGTTTG and (ii) 5 -GAATGTATTGAGGTTAA and 5 -GTATTTGTACTAAGCTTC AATGA (underlined residues indicate substitutions that were introduced to create sites for restriction). Plasmids pMSB1 and pMSB4, which were isolated from this screen, carried MSB1. pMSB4 , bearing a disrupted MSB1 coding region, was made by removing a BglII-BglII fragment from pMSB4. Two-hybrid analysis. The DBD (DNA-binding domain of LexA) fusions were constructed in pEG202 (15, 18). (These DBD fusion plasmids were kindly provided by C. De Virgilio, The University of North Carolina.) In the DBD fusion proteins, the Cys of the CAAX box (plus the adjacent Cys in Rho2p) of each GTPase was mutated to Ser to prevent prenylation (15, 56). pACTII contains the AD (transcriptional activation domain) of GAL4, LEU2, and 2 m ARS (19).

FIG. 1. Suppression of cdc42. Cells of cdc42-1 strain YMR420 containing the vectors YEp24 plus YEplac112 (A), YEp24 plus YEpSRO4 (a high-copy-number plasmid carrying SRO4) (B), pGYM50 (a high-copy-number plasmid carrying BEM4) plus YEplac112 (C), and pGYM50 plus YEpSRO4 (D) were streaked on SDCA Ade plates and incubated at the indicated temperatures for 2 days.

pPB725 contains the AD of GAL4 fused to the third codon of BEM4 in pACTII. pPB725 was constructed by first introducing a BamHI site at the third codon of BEM4 by site-directed mutagenesis using the oligonucleotide TTTCTTCGG GATCCATTTAG and then inserting a 2.5-kb BamHI-Sau3AI fragment containing BEM4 into the BamHI site of a version of pACTII in which the NcoI site had been filled in with Klenow fragment. pACTII and pPB725 were introduced separately into Y1050, selecting for transformants on SC-Leu. The plasmids that encode the DBD fusions were introduced into the resulting pACTII- and pPB725-bearing strains, selecting for transformants on SD Trp Ade Lys. Overnight liquid cultures were diluted 40-fold in SC Trp Ade Lys and grown for 8 h with shaking at 30 C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.1 to 0.5. -Galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (41). Four independent transformants were tested for each combination of plasmids. Morphological observations. Cells were stained with 4 ,6 -diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to reveal DNA and with rhodamine-phalloidin to reveal actin filaments as described previously (39). Cells were fixed with 5% formaldehyde for 10 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 8 mM Na2HPO4, 1.5 mM KH2PO4 [pH 7.3]), and then stained with a 1:50-diluted solution of rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.) for 2 h, and DAPI was added to a final concentration of 125 ng/ml. The cells were washed five times with PBS. These samples were mounted in 10 mg of n-propyl-gallate per ml in 90% glycerol and observed with an epifluorophotomicroscope (Olympus BH-2). Nucleotide sequence accession number. The sequence shown in Fig. 3 is available from EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ under accession number L27816.

RESULTS Isolation of multicopy suppressors of cdc42. SRO4, which was identified originally as a multicopy suppressor of rho3 (36), can serve as a weak multicopy suppressor of the growth defect of a cdc42-1 mutant at 34.5 C but fails to do so at 37 C (Fig. 1). To identify other genes whose functions are linked to Cdc42p, we screened for plasmids from a YEp24-based yeast genomic library that, in combination with a high-copy-number SRO4bearing plasmid, would allow suppression of a cdc42-1 mutant at 37 C. Seventy-eight plasmids were isolated in this screen. PCR analysis revealed that 74 of these contained CDC42. Restriction analysis indicated that the remaining plasmids, pGYM50, pGYM149, pGYM241, and pGYM245, harbored inserts derived from a single other genomic locus (Fig. 2). Although the ability of these plasmids to suppress cdc42 effectively at 37 C required co-overexpression of SRO4, each plasmid was sufficient for suppression at 34.5 C (Fig. 1). The suppressing activity was mapped to a 4.8-kb BglII-SalI segment (Fig. 2). The insertion of 4 bp (by using Klenow fragment) at the unique AflII site within this segment (in pGYM50-6) destroyed the suppressing activity. Sequence analysis of a 3.2-kb fragment of DNA from this region revealed that the AflII site is located within a large open reading frame for a new gene, which we call BEM4 (Fig. 3). The sequence of the inferred Bem4 protein is 633 amino acids long (Fig. 3). It is not similar to the sequence of any other known protein and contains no obvious motifs.

FIG. 2. Subcloning of BEM4. The inserts of the isolated BEM4 clones and subclones, and the bem4 disruption alleles, are diagrammed below the restriction map of the BEM4 region. and indicate growth and lack of growth of transformants (in YEpSRO4-bearing strain YMR420) after incubation for 3 days at 37 C. The coding region of BEM4 is represented by an open arrow. Shadowed arrows represent the coding region of URA3. The open box indicates the fragment used as a probe for physical mapping. The small arrowhead represents the AflII site at which 4 bp were inserted into pGYM50-6. All A (AflII), B (BstXI), E (EcoRI), G (BglII), P (PvuII), S (SalI), and V (EcoRV) and some H (HpaI), N (NruI), Sa (Sau3AI), and Sp (SpeI) sites are shown.

Disruption of BEM4. To investigate the function of BEM4, we deleted it from the MATa/MAT diploid strain YPH501 (see Materials and Methods). Segregants deleted for BEM4 were viable at 30 C but inviable at 37 C. When an exponentially growing culture of bem4 strain GYM5-1 was shifted from 30 to 37 C, cells began to stop dividing after approximately 5 h (data not shown). Eight hours after the shift, approximately 80% of the cells were unbudded, round, and large (Fig. 4). Approximately 20% of all cells contained two nuclei. These phenotypes are similar to those caused by loss of Cdc42p function (1). Although the distribution of actin appeared normal at 30 C (Fig. 4A), actin patches were distributed throughout the cell cortex at 37 C (Fig. 4B). Identification of CDC42 multicopy-suppressee mutants. Mutants that require multiple copies of CDC42 for survival were sought from strains PY406 and PY407, which contain the CDC42- and ADE3-bearing plasmid pPB320, using a colonysectoring assay (see Materials and Methods). In this assay, a mutant that requires multiple copies of CDC42 for survival forms uniformly red colonies that lack white sectors (Sect phenotype). We imagined that different mutations might be suppressed by CDC42 at different temperatures, and so we searched for CDC42-requiring mutants at 30, 34, and 37 C. Prior experience (3) suggested that the Sect phenotype of most or all of the dominant Sect mutants would be due to integration of pPB320 into the genome. Therefore, we did not pursue any dominant Sect mutants. Among the remaining mutants, we identified four complementation groups that required specifically CDC42, as opposed to ADE3 or LEU2, from pPB320 for survival (see Materials and Methods) (Table 2). By a combination of complementation and plasmid-based suppression tests, the group I and group II mutants were deduced to be defective in CDC42 and CDC24, respectively. The isolation of mutations in CDC42 and CDC24 was expected because CDC42 is essential for viability (26) and CDC42 was previously isolated as a multicopy suppressor of cdc24 (2). The following results suggest that strain PY632, the sole member of group III, is defective in BEM1. First, the diploid formed by crossing PY632 to bem1::LEU2 strain PY975, when cured of plasmid at 23 C, was unable to grow at 37 C. Second, when transformed with a low-copynumber plasmid bearing BEM1, PY632 became Sect . The growth defects of the bem1::LEU2 strain Y1008 at 35 C could be partially suppressed by overexpression of CDC42 (from plasmid pPB102), demonstrating that CDC42 can indeed serve as a multicopy suppressor of bem1. From the results of complementation and plasmid-based suppression tests, we concluded that the group IV mutants were not defective in any of the known bud emergence genes CDC24, CDC42, CDC43, BEM1, or BEM2 (data not shown). Members of this group, although Sect at 30 C or higher temperatures, were Sect at 23 C. From the YCp50-based genomic library, we isolated a plasmid that could suppress both the Sect phenotype of group IV mutant PY808 at 30 C and the growth phenotype of the same strain at 37 C (after loss of pPB320 at 23 C). A 2.6-kb NruI-Sau3A segment of the insert from this plasmid (Fig. 2 and 3) was sufficient for the suppression of both the Ts growth defect and the Sect phenotype. A 3.2-kb segment of DNA that encompasses this suppressing region was sequenced and found to contain BEM4 (Fig. 2 and 3). bem4 strain Y1051, which grows only poorly at 30 C and is inviable at 33 C, could grow well at temperatures up to 37 C when transformed with the high-copy-number, CDC42-bearing plasmid pPB320 (data not shown), indicating that the Ts

growth defect of bem4 mutants can indeed be suppressed by overexpression of CDC42. However, for reasons that are not yet clear, high-copy-number CDC42 was not sufficient for suppression of the bem4 growth defect in the unrelated strain GYM5-11 (see Fig. 5C; discussed below). Although mutations in CDC42 and CDC24 were isolated from screens using both PY406 and PY407, all 32 of the bem4 mutants were derived from PY407 (and none were derived from PY406), suggesting that PY407 may contain one or more other mutations that are required for the Sect phenotype of bem4 cells. In crosses between each of two group IV (bem4 Sect Ts ) mutants and Y382 (BEM4 Sect Ts ), the Ts : Ts phenotype segregated 2:2, confirming that loss of BEM4 function is sufficient for the Ts phenotype at 37 C. However, only approximately half of the Ts segregants, and none of the Ts segregants, were Sect at 30 C (Table 3), suggesting that a single other mutation is required for the Sect phenotype of bem4 mutants. We have not yet identified this second mutation. Identification of mutations that display synthetic lethality with cdc24. Cells carrying the cdc24-4 mutation, although unable to grow at 37 C, can grow well at 30 C. To search for mutations that displayed synthetic lethality with cdc24, we used a colony-sectoring assay to screen for mutations that caused cdc24-4 strains PY88 and PY92 to require CDC24 (on the ADE3-bearing plasmid pPB170) for survival at 30 C. From this screen, 161 recessive Sect mutants were isolated. From the results of complementation and linkage analyses, we determined that 159 of these mutants were likely to be defective in CDC24. These mutants were not studied further. One of the two remaining Sect mutants, PY278, was judged to be defective in BEM1 because (i) a BEM1-containing, low-copy-number plasmid was able to suppress its Sect phenotype and (ii) the diploid created by crossing it to bem1::LEU2 strain PY899, when cured of plasmid at 23 C, was unable to grow at 37 C. The single remaining Sect mutant that was identified from this screen is strain 10.7. From the results of tetrad analysis, we judged that the Sect phenotype of 10.7 was due to a syntheticlethal interaction between cdc24-4 and a second mutation that, by itself, also gave a Ts growth phenotype (data not shown). A single plasmid that could suppress the Ts phenotype was isolated from the YCp50-based genomic library. Restriction analysis indicated that this plasmid contained BEM4. Moreover, the diploid strain formed by crossing Y704 (a derivative of 10.7, cured of plasmid) to bem4 -2::URA3 strain Y833 was unable to grow at 37 C, strongly suggesting that Y704 does indeed contain a mutation in BEM4. In a cross between bem4 -1:: URA3 strain GYM5-2 and cdc24-4 strain JC24-4, although both the cdc24-4 BEM4 and CDC24 bem4 -1::URA3 segregants grew well at 32 C, the bem4 -1::URA3 cdc24-4 segregants were inviable at this temperature (data not shown), confirming that cdc24-4 is synthetically lethal with bem4. Two-hybridinteractionsinvolvingBem4pandRho-typeGTPases. Cdc42p displays a two-hybrid interaction with Bem4p (Table 4). Combined with the multicopy suppressor and multicopy suppressee relationships between BEM4 and CDC42, this two-hybrid interaction suggests that Cdc42p binds to Bem4p during the normal functions of these proteins.

Genetic interactions between BEM4 and RHO1. The twohybrid interaction between Bem4p and Rho1p suggests that these two proteins may interact functionally with each other. To explore this possibility, we examined whether RHO1 could serve as a multicopy suppressor of the Ts growth defect caused by deletion of BEM4. To do so, we exploited the finding that overexpression of CDC42 was not sufficient for suppression of the growth defect of bem4 strain GYM5-11 at 37 C (Fig. 5C). Overexpression of RHO1 alone was also insufficient for suppression at 37 C (Fig. 5B). However, co-overexpression of RHO1 and CDC42 effected strong suppression (Fig. 5D), suggesting that Bem4p does indeed play a role in the function of Rho1p in addition to its putative role in the function of Cdc42p. Identification of multicopy suppressors of bem4. To investigate further the function of Bem4p, we screened for multicopy suppressors of the Ts growth defect of a bem4 mutant. From a high-copy-number yeast genomic library, we identified 11 plasmids that enabled GYM5-11 cells to grow well at 37 C (see Materials and Methods). The results of restriction analysis indicated that two of these plasmids carry BEM4 itself and the other nine contain DNA from four other loci (data not shown). From restriction and PCR analysis (see Materials and Methods), we determined that one of these loci contained MSB1 (data not shown), a gene that was shown previously to be a multicopy suppressor of both cdc24 and cdc42 in sorbitolcontaining medium (2) and to display synthetic-lethal interactions with bem1 and bem2 (3). Deletion of a 0.5-kb BglII-BglII fragment from within the MSB1 open reading frame of the isolated plasmid eliminated its ability to suppress the Ts growth defect of GYM5-11, indicating that the relevant gene in this insert is indeed MSB1 (data not shown). The characterization of the three remaining multicopy suppressors of bem4, which we call SBE1-3, will be presented elsewhere. DISCUSSION The goal of this study was to identify genes whose functions are linked to that of Cdc42p. We discovered BEM4 from screens for (i) multicopy suppressors of cdc42, (ii) mutations

FIG. 4. Phenotypes of bem4 mutants. A culture of bem4 -1::URA3 strain GYM5-1 that was growing exponentially at 30 C was split in two; one culture was kept at 30 C, and the other was grown at 37 C. Cultures were harvested after 8 h at 30 C (A) or 37 C (B and C) and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin to reveal actin (A and B) and with DAPI to reveal DNA (C). The bar represents 5 m.

Cdc42pQ61L are mutant versions of Cdc42p that are predicted to exist predominantly in the GTP-bound state. Cdc42pD118A is a mutant version of Cdc42p that gives a dominant negative phenotype and is predicted to have a conformation similar to that of the GDP-bound, inactive form (55, 56). All three of these mutant versions of Cdc42p displayed comparable twohybrid interactions with Bem4p, suggesting that Bem4p can interact with both the active and inactive forms of Cdc42p. Bem4p also displays two-hybrid interactions with Rho1p, Rho2p, and Rho4p (Table 4), suggesting that Bem4p binds to multiple Rho-type GTPases. However, we failed to detect twohybrid interactions between Bem4p and either Rho3p (Table 4) or the Ras-type GTPase Ras2p (15a).

that required multiple copies of CDC42 for survival, and (iii) mutations that displayed synthetic lethality with a mutant allele of CDC24. The only other genes that were isolated from these screens were CDC24 (from the second screen) and BEM1 (from the second and third screens), suggesting that these screens were indeed selective for genes whose functions are tightly linked to that of Cdc42p. At high temperatures, deletion of BEM4 can cause cells to become unbudded, round, large, and multinucleate, consistent with the view that Bem4p functions with Cdc42p in bud emergence. Suppression of the Ts growth defect of bem4 strain GYM5-1 required co-overexpression of RHO1 and CDC42, suggesting that Bem4p also plays a role in Rho1p function. MSB1, which can serve as a multicopy suppressor of the Ts growth defect of bem4 cells, can also serve as a multicopy suppressor of the Ts growth phenotypes of both cdc42 (3) and rho1 (40a) mutants, consistent with a model in which Bem4p promotes the actions of both Cdc42p and Rho1p. Strong support for the idea that Bem4p promotes the action of Rho1p comes from the recent isolation of BEM4 as a multicopy suppressor of the growth defect caused by a dominant negative allele of rho1 (22). Additional support for this view is the finding that SBE1, which we isolated as a multicopy suppressor of the Ts growth defect of the bem4 mutant GYM5-1, maps to the same locus (adjacent to PHO85 on chromosome XVI [36a]) that was identified recently as a multicopy suppressor of rho1 (40a). The phenotypes caused by deletion of BEM4 varied with genetic background. For example, the restrictive temperatures for growth caused by deletion of BEM4 were different for different strains. Also, although deletion of BEM4 from some strains (e.g., YPH501 [Fig. 4], W303, and KA31 [data not shown]) caused cells to become unbudded, large, round, and multinucleate at 37 C, its deletion from other strains (e.g., Y799) did not cause such obvious bud emergence defects. Instead, bem4 cells derived from Y799 became misshapen and lysed at 37 C (32a). We have observed similar effects with BEM1 and BEM2, whose products are also linked to the functions of Rho-type GTPases; in some strains, the deletion of either gene leads to a bud emergence defect, whereas in other strains, these deletions result in misshapen cells that lyse at high temperatures. In addition, the restrictive temperature for deletion of either BEM1 or BEM2 can vary from one strain to another (1a). We have not yet identified the background mu-

tations that affect the phenotypes of strains deleted for the BEM genes. Because genetic and two-hybrid interactions suggest that Bem4p can affect the functions of both Cdc42p and Rho1p, it is possible that the phenotypic variation of different bem4 strains is due to one or more background mutations that affect the functions of one or the other or both of these GTPases. The Ts growth defect of bem4 strain Y1051 can be efficiently suppressed by overexpression of CDC42 alone, suggesting that this strain may be relatively insensitive to the bem4 effects on Rho1p function. In contrast, the finding that cooverexpression of CDC42 and RHO1 is required for suppression of the Ts growth defect of bem4 strain GYM5-1 suggests that this strain may have one or more mutations that make it particularly sensitive to impaired Rho1p function. Bem4p displays two-hybrid interactions with Cdc42p, Rho1p, Rho2p, and Rho4p. These GTPases are not so similar in sequence to one another that any protein that displays a twohybrid interaction with one will inevitably interact with the others; various other proteins that display two-hybrid interactions with Cdc42p (e.g., Cla4p, Ste20p, Bem3p, and Rga1p) failed to display two-hybrid interactions with Rho1p-Rho4p (15, 46, 49). Thus, these GTPases can be discriminated from one another in two-hybrid assays. The genetic interactions between Bem4p and both Cdc42p and Rho1p support the view that Bem4p binds to Cdc42p and Rho1p during normal function in vivo. In this context, it is likely that the two-hybrid interactions between Bem4p and both Rho2p and Rho4p also reflect interactions that occur in vivo. The ability of Bem4p to display two-hybrid interactions with wild-type Cdc42p, Cdc42pG12V, Cdc42pQ61L, and Cdc42pD118A (Table 4) suggests that Bem4p can bind to both the active and inactive forms of Cdc42p. Of the proteins known to bind to Rho-type GTPases (e.g., GDIs, GEFs, GAPs, and effectors), only Rho GDIs can bind to both the GDP- and GTP-bound states of multiple Rho-type GTPases, raising the possibility that Bem4p itself may serve one or more roles associated with Rho GDI. Some support for this possibility is the observation that although RDI1, which encodes a yeast Rho GDI, normally can be deleted without obvious effect on cell growth (34), RDI1 becomes essential, or nearly so, in cells that lack BEM4 (34a). However, Rdi1p appears to account for all of the Rho GDI activity in yeast strains (34). Furthermore, Bem4p is not similar in sequence to known Rho GDIs, and RDI1 cannot serve as a

multicopy suppressor of bem4 (34a). Thus, although Bem4p may have a function related to that of Rho GDI, we think that Bem4p itself is unlikely to be a Rho GDI. Other potential roles for Bem4p include promoting the folding, stability, or localization of multiple Rho-type GTPases or regulating the binding of these GTPases to their targets or regulatory proteins (e.g., GEFs, GAPs, GDIs, processing proteins, or degradation machinery).
