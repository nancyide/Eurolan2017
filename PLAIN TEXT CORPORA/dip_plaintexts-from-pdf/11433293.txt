Genetic evidence suggests that the securin Pds1p is the target of a late-S-phase checkpoint control. Here we show that Pds1p becomes essential once two-thirds of the genome has been replicated and that the coupling of the completion of genome replication with mitosis relies on the regulation of Pds1p levels. Mec1p is needed to maintain Pds1p levels under S-phase checkpoint conditions. In contrast, Rad53p and Chk1p, needed for the stabilization of Pds1p in the context of the G2 DNA-damage checkpoint pathway, are dispensable. Thus, the Pds1p-dependent lateS-phase checkpoint pathway couples replication with mitosis but is mechanistically distinct from the G2 DNAdamage checkpoint. Finally, we show that the inhibition of spindle elongation in early S phase, controlled by the Mec1p/Rad53p branch, is not regulated via Pds1p/Esp1p. This can mechanistically explain the need for branched S-phase checkpoint controls.

he onset of anaphase in yeast is preceded by ubiquitindependent proteolysis of the anaphase inhibitor Pds1p (refs 1, 2). Pds1p inhibits Esp1p separase activity that promotes a loss of sister-chromatid cohesion and elongation of the mitotic spindle3,4. Pds1p proteolysis is antagonized by checkpoint controls that regulate mitotic progression in response to either DNA damage or aberrantly formed spindles5­7. More recently, Pds1p was implicated in S-phase checkpoint control, a surveillance system that prevents mitosis when DNA replication is perturbed8. The S-phase checkpoint was originally defined by the phenotype of rad53 and mec1 budding yeast mutants that failed to restrain spindle elongation when DNA replication was blocked with the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU). Rad53p and Mec1p are the homologues of human kinase Chk2 and kinases ATM/ATR, respectively. In budding yeast, mitotic spindles form during S phase; restraining spindle elongation is therefore a function of the S-phase checkpoint. mec1-1 and rad53-1 mutants are unable to restrain spindle elongation even when DNA replication is blocked in early S phase9,10. Under the same conditions, when DNA replication is blocked in early S phase, pds1-null mutants are competent to prevent spindle elongation5,6,8. However, in the presence of amounts of HU insufficient to arrest replication, pds1 mutant cells lose sister-chromatid cohesion and initiate spindle elongation partway through S phase8. Therefore, Mec1p/Rad53p and Pds1p have different roles in S-phase checkpoint control. The realization that Pds1p might be important for the S-phase checkpoint was significant, because Pds1p controls the maintenance of cohesion between sister chromatids as well as regulating spindle elongation. Because sister-chromatid cohesion must be maintained from S phase until the onset of anaphase in all eukaryotes, the role of Pds1p in S-phase checkpoint control is likely to be highly relevant. However, little is known about the precise function and regulation of Pds1p in the context of the S-phase checkpoint. Whether Pds1 is exclusively needed in late S phase has not been satisfactorily addressed and it is not known whether the Sphase checkpoint pathway involving Pds1p is completely distinct from the G2 DNA-damage response.

Here we show unequivocally that Pds1p is needed for S-phase checkpoint control when about two-thirds of the genome has been replicated and that this requirement is actually determined by the amount of replicated DNA. Pds1p levels are maintained in S phase in a checkpoint-dependent manner. Mec1p is required to maintain Pds1p levels in response to S-phase checkpoint activation. Instead, kinase Rad53p and the DNA-damage checkpoint kinase Chk1p are dispensable for this response, indicating that these kinases cannot be the only elements acting downstream of Mec1p in the context of the S-phase checkpoint. Therefore, the late-S-phase Pds1p-dependent pathway is distinct from the G2 DNA-damage checkpoint response, which does involve Chk1p. Finally, we determined why Pds1p is not needed for the early-S-phase checkpoint response. In contrast to the essential role of Esp1p for spindle elongation in mitosis, we find that Esp1p is not the initiator of, and is not required for, spindle elongation during early S phase. Therefore, stabilization of Esp1p inhibitor, Pds1p, is not a relevant function of Mec1p in early S phase. We propose a model in which the S-phase checkpoint control consists of dual mechanisms, one needed early in S phase, the other operative in late S phase once sister-chromatid cohesion has been established.

Results Pds1p is not required for spindle elongation in early S phase. In early S phase, the Mec1p/Rad53p-dependent S-phase checkpoint inhibits spindle elongation. Pds1p is thought not to be needed for this checkpoint response because, unlike mec1-1 and rad53-1 mutants, pds1-null cells do not undergo spindle elongation when replication is blocked early in S phase5,6,8. However, an alternative explanation could be that pds1 mutants are not capable of initiating spindle elongation early in S phase, reflecting an underlying requirement for Pds1p for normal spindle function. Indeed, Pds1p is required for the association of Esp1p with the spindle and Esp1p is required for spindle elongation4. We therefore asked whether Pds1p is needed for spindle elongation during early S phase by comparing the kinetics of cell cycle progression and spindle elongation in

rad53-1 and pds1-128 rad53-1 mutant cells in the presence of 100 mM HU (Fig. 1a). (Although the pds1-128 mutant8 was used for these experiments, pds1-null cells gave similar results; data not shown). After release from G1 arrest, both mutants budded and formed short G2 spindles with similar timing. Onset of anaphase also occurred with comparable kinetics in both mutants (Fig. 1a). Clearly, cells that lack Pds1p are competent to undergo spindle elongation in early S phase. Thus, deregulated spindle elongation in rad53-1 cells is indeed independent of a requirement for Pds1p for spindle function. Pds1p-dependent checkpoint responds to blocked replication forks in late S phase. Although pds1-null mutants are competent to prevent spindle elongation when DNA replication is blocked early in S phase, both a loss of sister-chromatid cohesion and spindle elongation occur before genome replication is complete when pds1 mutants are grown in the presence of amounts of HU insufficient to arrest replication8. Therefore, Mec1p/Rad53p and Pds1p have different roles in S-phase checkpoint control. These data might mean that Rad53p and Mec1p are required for an early-S-phase checkpoint response that inhibits spindle elongation9,10, whereas Pds1p might be specifically required for a late-S-phase checkpoint8. Alternatively, these experiments could suggest that different signals are produced by stalled replication forks (in 0.4 M HU) from those produced by replication forks that are progressing slowly (in 0.1 M HU). If the latter is correct, then Pds1p might be needed only for transmitting checkpoint signals when DNA replication is continuing (0.1 M HU). To differentiate between these possibilities, DNA replication was completely blocked in pds1 mutant cells in early, mid or late S phase and the ability of the cells to maintain cell cycle arrest was determined (Fig. 1b, c). After release from G1 arrest, pds1-128 mutants were allowed to progress slowly through S phase in the presence of 0.1 M HU. In three identical cultures, the HU

Figure 2 Loss of sister-chromatid cohesion and spindle elongation are linked to the extent of ongoing DNA replication in pds1-128 cells. pds1-128 cells8 were arrested in G1 with -factor, then released into rich medium containing 50 mM HU (squares), 100 mM HU (diamonds) or 150 mM HU (circles). Strains were used that contained the tetO/tetR­GFP system for analysis of sister-chromatid cohesion at the TRP1 locus (a) or a GFP­TUB1 construct to allow analysis of mitotic spindles (b). a, Cell aliquots were taken at intervals for scoring budding index (blue) and sister centromere separation (white fill)8, and for FACScan analysis. b, Cell aliquots were taken for scoring budding index (blue), spindle formation (white) and spindle elongation (black), and for FACScan analysis. FACScan data show DNA content profiles for each HU concentration. Times after release from G1 are given at the right of the FACScan plots and the percentage loss of cohesion (LOC) or the percentage of elongated spindles (ES) is indicated in each relevant FACScan plot. The positions of the 1C and 2C peaks were determined by using the FACScan profiles of the asynchronous cultures of pds1-128 cells before G1 arrest (overlaid on the FACScan plots as in Fig. 1).

concentration was increased to 0.4 M either in early S phase (Fig. 1c, left column), mid S phase (middle column) or late S phase (right column) to block DNA replication. Elongation of the mitotic spindles was then analysed and replication arrest was confirmed by FACScan analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, the pds1 mutant cells were able to maintain cell cycle arrest when DNA replication was blocked either in early S phase or when about one-third of the genome had been replicated. In contrast, when DNA replication was arrested in late S phase, the pds1 mutant cells were unable to restrain mitotic spindle elongation (Fig. 1b) and proceeded to exit from mitosis (data not shown). Therefore, the Pds1p-dependent S-phase checkpoint is needed equally when DNA replication is continuing and when replication forks have stalled, but is specific to late S phase of the cell cycle. Pds1p is not needed for maintaining sister-chromatid cohesion in early S phase. As well as initiating spindle elongation in the presence of HU in late S phase, pds1 mutants lose cohesion between sister chromatids at the TRP1 locus8. It is not known whether Pds1p is dispensable for maintaining cohesion in the presence of 100 mM HU earlier in S phase because the earliest time at which cohesion could be lost at TRP1 has not been defined. We addressed this critical issue by comparing the timing of sister-chromatid separation at TRP1 in pds1 mutants with scc1 mutants, because Scc1p is absolutely required for the establishment of cohesion during S phase (Fig. 1d). Maintenance of cohesion was monitored with the tetR­greenfluorescent-protein (GFP)/tetO(TRP1) system8. In S-phase cells, unreplicated TRP1 loci, or replicated TRP1 loci at which cohesion is maintained, yield a single GFP signal. Once cohesion is lost, two GFP signals are seen within the same S-phase cell. pds1 and scc1 mutants were arrested in G1 with mating pheromone, then released into rich medium containing 100 mM HU. Cell cycle progression was monitored by scoring budding and by FACScan analysis; the accumulation of cells with two GFP signals was scored. As shown in Fig. 1d, loss of cohesion at TRP1 occurred very early in S phase in the scc1 mutant. The TRP1 locus must therefore have been replicated early in S phase and the resulting sister loci were able to separate far enough to yield two discrete GFP signals. In contrast, loss of cohesion occurred much later in pds1 mutant cells when more than half of the genome had been replicated. Pds1p is therefore needed only for maintaining sister-chromatid cohesion in late S phase. A novel inhibitor of sister-chromatid separation presumably controls cohesion earlier in S phase. Pds1p-dependent S-phase checkpoint monitors the last about onethird of genome replication. In the above experiments, Pds1p was

Average anaphase spindle lengths were determined from 50 digital images (each strain)33 taken when ~40% of the cells had elongated spindles: 9.3 ± 2.2 µm in mec1-1, 8.8 ± 2 µm in rad53-1, 9.0 ± 1.9 µm in pds1-128, and 9.5 ± 2.0 µm in wild type. c, mec1-1 and pds1-128, but not rad53-1, rebud in the presence of HU.

only needed when DNA replication was arrested in late S phase. Therefore, there must be a critical event, part way through the cell cycle, that establishes a dependence on Pds1p for preventing the onset of anaphase while genome replication is incomplete. The execution of this transition might be linked to the progression of genome replication itself, or it could simply be initiated with a given timing after release from G1 phase. In the latter case, for example, dependence on Pds1p might be established only once mitotic Cdc28p/Clb1p and Cdc28p/Clb2p kinase activities are present in cells. To explore these alternatives, pds1-128 cells released from G1 arrest were grown with various HU concentrations, and the timing of loss of cohesion between sister chromatids and spindle elongation was monitored with the GFP-tagged sub-centromere-linked probe (Fig. 2a) or GFP­tubulin (Fig. 2b)8. In these experiments, cells progressed from G1 (budded) at similar rates, regardless of the HU concentration. In contrast, the rate of DNA replication was controlled by the HU concentration, being slowest at the highest HU dose (150 mM) and quickest at the lowest dose (50 mM). Strikingly, loss of cohesion and spindle elongation occurred at different times

Figure 5 Spindle elongation in early S phase is independent of Esp1p and Pds1p. a, Immunoprecipitation (IP) of Esp1p­Pds1p complexes from wild-type or rad53-1 grown in the presence of HU. Samples from kinetic experiments (Fig. 4) were used for immunoprecipitating Esp1[myc18]p (upper panel) or Pds1[HA]p (not shown). Lanes 1, samples taken 1 h 20 min after release from G1; lanes 2, samples taken after 2 h 20 min. For wild type (WT), lanes 1 and 2 contained cells arrested with short G2 spindles and partly replicated DNA; for rad53-1, cells were arrested with short G2 spindles and partly replicated DNA (lane 1) or at anaphase with partly replicated DNA (lane 2). Lower panel: amounts of Esp1p and Pds1p in the extracts. A strain with an untagged Esp1p was used as a control (lane C). b, Spindle elongation in esp1-B3 rad53-1. rad53-1 (squares), esp1-B3 (triangles) and rad53-1 esp1-B3 (circles) were arrested in G1 with -factor, then released into rich medium (left panel) or rich medium plus 100 mM HU (right panel) at 31 °C. White, spindle formation; black, spindle elongation. c, Model for S-phase checkpoint bifurcation. Two pathways coordinate replication with mitosis. In early S phase, the Mec1p/Rad53p pathway prevents spindle elongation by an unknown mechanism (X) that does not involve the inhibition of Esp1p. A mechanistically distinct checkpoint (Mec1p/Pds1p pathway) becomes essential in late S phase, once cohesion has been established (dashed line). Mec1p maintains Pds1p levels under S-phase checkpoint conditions. The late-S-phase pathway inhibits Esp1p, preventing a loss of sister-chromatid cohesion and blocking spindle elongation. Sequential checkpoints are required because, once cohesion has been established, spindle elongation and loss of cohesion are regulated coordinately, whereas spindle elongation is inhibited independently of loss of cohesion before cohesion has been established.

after entry into S phase, depending on the concentration of HU and therefore on the rate of DNA replication (Fig. 2). The higher the HU dose, the longer was the delay before cohesion was lost and before spindle elongation was initiated. Thus, the timing of anaphase onset was correlated with the extent of DNA replication accomplished. Onset of anaphase always occurred when about one-third of the genome had not been replicated. These data suggest that the switch from early to late-S-phase checkpoint control is determined by a factor intrinsically linked to DNA replication. Pds1 protein levels are maintained during a prolonged S phase. The above experiments establish that Pds1p is needed for a late-Sphase checkpoint control that couples mitotic progression to completion of the last roughly one-third of genome replication. As with the DNA-damage or spindle-assembly checkpoints, Pds1p-mediated anaphase delay in response to S-phase checkpoint activation might rely on persistent Pds1p levels while replication is in progress. However, execution of the Pds1p-dependent S-phase checkpoint function could equally occur in early S phase, negating a need for Pds1p stabilization in late S phase. To address this possibility, we compared the kinetics of anaphase onset in the presence of 100 mM HU in wild-type and HU-sensitive pds1-128 cells8 expressing epitope-tagged versions of Pds1p or mutant Pds1-128p, respectively (Fig. 3). Cells were synchronized in G1 with mating pheromone, followed by release into rich medium containing 100 mM HU at 26 °C. Cell-cycle progression was monitored by scoring budding index, mitotic spindle formation and elongation (using the GFP­TUB1 construct) and by FACScan analysis. Wild-type cells began anaphase 5 h after release from G1, when the genome had been fully replicated (Fig. 3, and data not shown). Under these conditions of slow DNA replication, Pds1[HA]p persisted for about 3 h longer than in cells released from G1 into rich medium without HU, and its degradation was initiated simultaneously with the onset of anaphase (Fig. 3b). Thus, Pds1p levels are maintained while DNA replication is continuing in yeast. pds1-128 mutant cells began anaphase 3 h after release from G1, when the cells were partway through S phase (Fig. 3). Epitope-tagged Pds1-128[HA]p was markedly reduced after 2.5 h, indicating that the mutant protein could not be stabilized in response to activation of the S-phase checkpoint (Fig. 3b). Thus, persistence of Pds1p in the presence of 100 mM HU seemed to be crucial for anaphase delay, which was consistent with the checkpoint defect observed in pds1-128 cells. Mec1p maintains Pds1p levels under S-phase checkpoint conditions. When replication is perturbed, Pds1p levels are maintained until the genome has been fully replicated. An unanswered question is whether Pds1p levels are maintained by the S-phase checkpoint machinery. Mec1p and Rad53p might be involved in this regulation if the early-S-phase and late-S-phase checkpoint pathways are biochemically linked. We therefore compared the kinetics of anaphase initiation and Pds1p destruction in mec1-1 and rad53-1 mutant cells, released from a mating-factor-induced G1 block, in the presence of 100 mM HU (Fig. 4a). Both mutants budded and formed short G2 spindles with similar timing. Both mutants also initiated spindle elongation early in S phase, when very little DNA had been replicated (Fig. 4a, and data not shown). This is consistent with biochemical analyses indicating that Mec1p and Rad53p function in the same pathway11. In mec1-1 mutant cells, Pds1[HA]p was degraded during S phase, indicating that Mec1p is required to prevent Pds1[HA]p proteolysis when replication is perturbed (Fig. 4a). This result suggests that Mec1p might act upstream of Pds1p in the context of S-phase checkpoint control (see the model in Fig. 5c). In contrast, Pds1[HA]p levels were maintained in rad53-1 cells even beyond the time at which degradation occurred in wild-type cells (Fig. 4a). rad53-1 and a rad53-null strain, kept alive by overproduction of the RNR1 gene, gave the same results (data not shown), which is consistent with other data indicating that rad53-1 and rad53 have equally penetrant checkpoint control defects12. Rad53p is therefore not required to inhibit Pds1[HA]p proteolysis in S phase. Apparently, Rad53p does not perform all of the Mec1pdependent S-phase checkpoint functions. Mec1p might control both early and late-S-phase checkpoint pathways, whereas Rad53p seems to function specifically in the S-phase checkpoint pathway

that restrains spindle elongation in early S phase. In agreement with the biochemistry of Pds1p degradation, the phenotype of mec1-1 and rad53-1 (and rad53-null) mutants differed with regard to cell cycle progression after spindle elongation in the presence of HU. Although both mutants elongated their spindles with the same timing in early S phase, mec1-1 mutants exited from mitosis and eventually rebudded, whereas rad53-1 cells and rad53 became arrested with elongated mitotic spindles (Fig. 4a­c). On the basis of these data, we propose that Rad53p and Pds1p define distinct branches of the S-phase checkpoint, both acting downstream of Mec1p but each being a relevant target in either early or late S phase, respectively (see model in Fig. 5c). DNA-damage checkpoint kinase Chk1p does not contribute to Pds1p persistence during continuing DNA replication. The above data support the notion that the S-phase checkpoint operates by at least two distinct branches, both acting downstream of Mec1p kinase. Interestingly, a similar principle has been established for the organization of the checkpoint control pathways that respond to DNA damage12,13. DNA-damage checkpoint arrest depends on the maintenance of Pds1p levels, which is controlled by kinases Mec1p, Chk1p and Rad53p (ref. 12). In the presence of DNA damage, and once DNA replication is complete, mec1-1 mutant cells fail to delay in G2 owing to a complete inability to maintain Pds1p levels. As part of this G2 DNA-damage response, the RAD53 and CHK1 gene products act in parallel pathways, each controlled by Mec1p. The respective single mutants are partly defective in maintaining Pds1p levels, whereas the double mutant (rad53 chk1) cannot maintain Pds1p levels in G2. Accordingly, each mutant displays a residual G2/M delay, compared with mec1-1 cells, whereas a rad53 chk1 double mutant has a fully penetrant G2 checkpoint defect like that of mec1-1 cells12,13. Given this organization, it is conceivable that Rad53p and Chk1p might have redundant roles in maintaining Pds1p stability in the context of Sphase checkpoint control. Indeed, Chk1p is believed to be important for S-phase checkpoint function in Drosophila and Xenopus14­16. To address the question of whether a similar model held true during S-phase checkpoint activation in yeast, we analysed the kinetics of anaphase initiation and Pds1p destruction in chk1 cells and rad53-1 chk1 cells in the presence of 100 mM HU (Fig. 4d). The chk1 cells behaved identically to the wild type, degrading Pds1p and initiating anaphase once S phase was complete. In the double mutant (rad53-1 chk1) Pds1p levels persisted, much as they did in rad53-1 cells. The same was true when rad53 chk1 cells were analysed (data not shown). Therefore, in contrast to G2 DNA-damage checkpoint control, the Mec1p-dependent S-phase checkpoint function of maintaining Pds1p levels during S phase is not performed by Rad53p and Chk1p. This is consistent with the fact that Pds1p is phosphorylated in a Chk1p-dependent manner after DNA damage but is not phosphorylated in the presence of HU17. Together, these data strongly suggest that the Pds1p-dependent late-S-phase checkpoint is biochemically distinct from the G2 DNA-damage checkpoint. Esp1p is needed for spindle elongation in mitosis but not in early S phase. We have shown that Pds1p is not required for preventing spindle elongation in early S phase but is needed for a late-S-phase checkpoint distinct from the G2 DNA-damage response. Surprisingly, our data also show that the presence of Pds1p in early S phase is not sufficient to inhibit spindle elongation (see Fig. 4). Both mec1-1 and rad53-1 cells began anaphase before Pds1p was degraded in the presence of HU (Fig. 4a). Further, rad53-1 mutants initiated spindle elongation in the presence of HU, even when a non-degradable Pds1p mutant (lacking its destruction box motif Pds1pdb) was overexpressed from the GAL1 promoter (data not shown); however, note that this allele can block anaphase in rad53 mutants in an unperturbed cell cycle (data not shown) and in the context of the G2 DNA-damage checkpoint12. Thus, although Pds1p must be stabilized to prevent the premature initiation of anaphase during late S phase, the presence of Pds1p in early S phase is not sufficient to inhibit spindle elongation in HU-treated mec1-1 or rad53-1

articles cells. This could be explained by any of several mechanisms. First, Pds1p might be unable to bind and/or inhibit Esp1p in early S phase after checkpoint activation in rad53-1 cells. To test this, we immunoprecipitated Pds1p­Esp1p complexes from wild-type and rad53-1 cells treated with HU (Fig. 5a). We analysed samples of budded cells that had short G2 spindles, and samples of budded rad53-1 cells with anaphase spindles. In each sample taken from kinetic experiments as in Fig. 4, similar amounts of Pds1p­Esp1p complexes were isolated. The ability of rad53-1 cells to initiate spindle elongation in the presence of Pds1p therefore cannot be explained by a lack of Pds1p binding to Esp1p. This result suggested that Pds1p is incapable of inhibiting Esp1p in early S phase and also that Rad53p might inhibit Esp1p directly. An alternative possibility is that Esp1p activity is not required for spindle elongation in early S phase. However, this seems to be an unlikely model because Esp1p activity is absolutely required for spindle elongation in mitosis4,18. Still, we tested this hypothesis with the use of a novel esp1 mutant (esp1-B3), which is temperature sensitive at a relatively low temperature (30 °C), making it suitable for analysis of the kinetics of spindle elongation in synchronous cell cycles4. After release from G1 into rich medium at 31 °C, esp1-B3 and esp1-B3 rad53-1 could not elongate spindles when these cells reached mitosis (Fig. 5b). The rad53-1 mutation could therefore not relieve the inability of esp1-B3 cells to elongate spindles in mitosis. In the presence of HU, esp1-B3 cells were arrested with short G2 spindles while DNA replication was continuing, confirming that esp1-B3 cells are competent for the S-phase checkpoint. However, esp1-B3 rad53-1 cells and rad53-1 cells initiated spindle elongation with similar timing when grown in the presence of HU (Fig. 5b). Thus, although Esp1p is needed for spindle elongation at mitosis, spindle elongation in early S phase, on checkpoint activation, occurs by a mechanism that involves neither Pds1p nor Esp1p. This result can mechanistically explain the need for distinct and sequential branches of the S-phase checkpoint system. Whereas the late-Sphase checkpoint targets Pds1p/Esp1p, the early-S-phase checkpoint must have a novel target essential for restraining spindle elongation when replication is perturbed. Discussion Checkpoint controls maintain the order of cell-cycle events to guard against genome instability. The S-phase checkpoint ensures that DNA replication has been completed before cells attempt to divide. In budding yeast, this checkpoint system must inhibit the loss of sister-chromatid cohesion and prevent mitotic spindle elongation during S phase. When DNA is damaged, the G2 DNA-damage checkpoint arrests cells after the genome has been replicated, but before mitosis. This checkpoint allows time for DNA repair systems to act before cell division commences, and thereby prevents the inheritance of mutations. Identification of the proteins that make up these checkpoint pathways is a worthy goal because the genes that encode them are likely to be mutated in tumour cells. Although the S-phase checkpoint was initially described in budding yeast9,10, the relevance of this pathway to the control of mitosis in higher eukaryotes has been questioned. In budding yeast, the spindle apparatus can form during S phase, explaining the need for a checkpoint that restrains spindle elongation until DNA replication is complete. But in most eukaryotes, including mammals, mitotic spindles cannot form until mitosis. We have provided evidence that distinct S-phase checkpoint systems operate in yeast; a `Mec1p/Rad53p' pathway necessary in early S phase9,10, and a novel `Mec1p/Pds1p' pathway operating late in S phase (Fig. 5c). The late-S-phase checkpoint is likely to function in higher eukaryotes because this checkpoint pathway prevents the premature loss of sister-chromatid cohesion during late S phase, as well as inhibiting spindle elongation. In mammalian cells, loss of cohesion in S phase would disrupt the ability to biorient the chromosomes on

articles the metaphase plate during mitosis, because cohesion would be lost before spindle formation. In yeast, the late-S-phase checkpoint might couple DNA replication with mitosis by a Mec1pdependent maintenance of levels of Pds1p anaphase inhibitor. An analogous control system should exist in mammals to guard against premature sister-chromatid separation during S phase. Targets of the yeast late-S-phase checkpoint that control sisterchromatid cohesion--Pds1p and Esp1p--are functionally conserved in mammals19, but it remains to be determined whether the Mec1p homologues ATM and ATR regulate the sister-chromatid cohesion machinery in human cells. Indeed, it has not been rigorously demonstrated that cohesion is established during S phase in mammals. However, the only other factors that physically hold mammalian sister chromatids together, replicative DNA catenations, are known to be progressively resolved during S phase, when DNA topoisomerase-II de-catenatory activity increases20. Protein cohesion factors are therefore likely to be critical for maintaining sister-chromatid association in late S phase. We previously proposed that the Pds1p-dependent late-S-phase checkpoint is mechanistically distinct from the G2 DNA-damage checkpoint. This was based on the fact that pds1 mutants lose sister-chromatid cohesion and initiate spindle elongation partway through S phase8. In contrast, rad9 mutant cells that are defective for G2 DNA-damage checkpoint control13 are not defective in the S-phase checkpoint. rad9 cells are not sensitive to HU and are fully competent at coupling DNA replication with mitosis in the presence of 100 mM HU8. However, Rad9p is thought to control only part of the G2 DNA damage pathway. Here we show that Chk1p and Rad53p, needed for the G2 DNA-damage checkpoint, are not needed for maintaining Pds1p levels in response to S-phase checkpoint activation. Therefore the upstream activator (Rad9p) and downstream signalling components (Rad53p and Chk1p) of the G2 DNA-damage checkpoint pathway are not needed for the late-S-phase Pds1p-dependent pathway. These data unequivocally distinguish between the late-S-phase and G2 DNA-damage checkpoint control systems. This distinction is of further interest because recent work has implicated Chk1p from Xenopus and Drosophila in S-phase checkpoint control14­16. Moreover, because we show that Chk1p and Rad53p are not needed for Pds1p stabilization in the context of the S-phase checkpoint response, this Mec1p-dependent control of Pds1p levels must occur via a novel Mec1p substrate. In agreement with this biochemical result, the mec1-1 and rad53-1 phenotypes in 100 mM HU were not identical, indicating that Rad53p mediates only a subset of Mec1p-dependent functions. Under conditions of slow DNA replication, rad53-1 cells were proficient at maintaining Pds1p levels and did not exit mitosis, but accumulated with long anaphase spindles (Fig. 4a­c). This arrest phenotype could be accounted for by the persistence of Pds1p, which is sufficient to block the release of Cdc14p from nucleoli, an event that is needed for mitotic exit21­26. However, because Rad53p is needed for early-S-phase checkpoint control of spindle elongation, our data define distinct Sphase control systems. The early-S-phase Mec1p/Rad53p checkpoint must have a novel target because Esp1p does not participate in the control of spindle elongation at that time. An explanation for the duality of S-phase checkpoint control is the normal linkage of spindle elongation with regulation of sister-chromatid cohesion (Fig. 2). Eukaryotes establish cohesion during replication, and must maintain it until the onset of anaphase3,27­29. Once cohesion is established, checkpoint controls must coordinate the release of cohesion with spindle elongation. Early in S phase, before the replication of a significant portion of the genome and the concomitant establishment of cohesion, spindle elongation is presumably regulated independently of the machinery that monitors and regulates the status of cohesion (see Fig. 5c). However, once cohesion has been established, partway through S phase, a coordinate regulatory system becomes critical. The novel finding

that the separin Esp1p is needed for spindle elongation once cohesion has been established, but not in early S phase, supports this hypothesis.
