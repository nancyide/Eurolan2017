We report that a purified cytoplasmic Hsp70 homo- catalyzed by eukaryotic Hsp7O family members (9-15). In log from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Hsp7OSSA',ex- Saccharomyces cereuisiue different dnaJ homologs are localhibits a weak ATPaseactivity, which is stimulated by ized to the same subcellular compartments as the different

apurified eukaryotic dnaJp homolog(YDJlp).Stable complexformation between Hsp70SsA'andthepermanently unfolded protein carboxymethylated a-lactalbumin (CMLA) was assayed by native gel electrophoresis. Theaffinityof Hsp70ssA1 forCMLAappeared to be regulatedby YDJlp. Significant reductionin both CMLA-Hsp70sSA' complex formation and therelease ofCMLA pre-bound to Hsp70ssA1was observed only in the presence of both YDJlp and ATP. Thus, Hsp70ssA1 andYDJlp interact functionallyin the executionof Hsp70ssA1 chaperoneactivities intheeukaryotic cell.

Molecular chaperones of the Hsp70l family bind polypeptide substrates to stabilize or alter their conformation and hydrolyze ATP to facilitate polypeptide release (1).Intracellular processes in which Hsp7O family members participate include protection of cellsfrom thermal stress, proteinfolding and assembly,disassembly of protein complexes,protein degradation, protein trafficking, and the initiation of bacteriophage DNA replication in Escherichia coli (for reviews see Refs. 1-3). Several reportsindicate thatthe activity of the Hsp7O family members is regulated. In E. coli, Hsp7O (dnaKp)functionally interacts with two other heat shock proteins, dnaJp and grpEp, in bacteriophage X and P1 DNA replication (3).

Hsp70 members; YDJl is cytosolic (9, lo), SISl partitions between the cytosol and cell nucleus (ll), Sec63 is found in membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (12, 13),and SCJl is found in mitochondria (14). The YDJl gene encodes the more abundant of the two cytosolic dnaJp homologs and is required for normal cell growth (9,lO). YDJlpis farnesylated at a C-terminalCaaXbox (wherea is an aliphatic aminoacid and X is anyresidue), andthis modification appears to mediate partitioning of YDJlp between the cytosol and different intracellular membranes(9,16). To testfor interactions between the abundanteukaryotic Hsp70 family members and dnaJ homologs, YDJlp anda cytosolic Hsp7O homolog of S. cereuisiue, Hsp70SSA', werepurified. The influence of YDJlp on Hsp70 ATPase activity and polypeptide substratebinding and release were then examined. The results of such experiments arereported below. EXPERIMENTALPROCEDURES Purification of YDJlp-YDJlp was overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) asdescribed previously (16).Cells from a 200-ml culture were isolated, resuspended in 10volumes of ice cold buffer A (20mM MOPS, pH 7.5,0.5 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and thendisrupted by sonication. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 X g for 30 min. The SlOO was loaded directly onto a DE52 column (1.0 X 5.0 cm, Whatman) equilibrated with buffer A at 4 "C. The column was washed with 10 volumes of buffer A and bound YDJlp was eluted with a 0-300 mM NaCl gradient. Peak fractionscontaining YDJlp were pooled and

Purified dnaJp andgrpEp synergistically stimulate the ATP- then dialyzed against buffer B (5 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0,

ase activity of dnaKp; dnaJp stimulates ATP hydrolysis by dnaKp, whereas grpEp stimulatesadenine nucleotide exchange (4). dnaKp, dnaJp, andgrpEp canalso act sequentially to enhance in uitro protein folding catalyzed by the chaperonin groEL (Hsp6O;Ref. 5). In eukaryotes, unidentified Nethylmaleimide-sensitive factor(s)act with cytosolic Hsp70 molecules to maximally stimulate in uitro protein transport into mitochondria (6), theendoplasmic reticulum (7), and the cell nucleus (8). The recent identification of dnaJ homologs in eukaryotes suggests theyparticipate in at least some of the reactions * This work was supported in partby National Institutes of Health Grant GM36537 (toM.

YDJlpwas next loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column (1X 5 cm, Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer B at 4"C. The column was washed with 10 volumes of buffer B, and bound YDJlp was eluted with a5-400 mM potassium phosphate gradient. Peak fractions were pooled and then dialyzed against buffer C (10 mM Hepes, 50 mM NaC1,lO mM DTT, and10%glycerol),concentrated, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70 'C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Bradford assaykit with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Purification of an Hsp70 Fraction Enrichedin SSAlp-S. cereuisiae strain MW141 (Mata, ura3-52, leu2-3, 112, his3-11, 15, ssal::HIS3, ssa2::LEU2, ssa4::URA3,pGAL1-SSA1)was grown at 30 "Cin 6 liters of YP media supplementedwith2% galactose to induce high level expression of Hsp7OSSA'.Cells were harvested at ODsm= 10. The cell pellet (50 g, wet weight) was resuspended in 50 ml of 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Hepes (ph 7.4), 10mM DTT, 2 mM MgC12, 0.5mM EDTA, 10 FM leupeptin,10 GM pepstatin,and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were disrupted by agitation with glass beads (6 pulses of l-min duration, which were followed by a 10-min cooling period) using a Beadbeater (Biospec). Hsp70 molecules present in the SlOO of the lysate were purified by chromatography on ATP-agarose (C-8 linked, Sigma)and DE52 (Whatman)columns asdescribedpreviously (17,181.

cubated in reaction mixtures containing 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 10mM DTT, 2 mMMgC12, and ATP (asindicated, [(U-~~P] ATP, 7.0 x 10' to 1.0 x 10' Cpm/pM). Reaction mixtures were set up on ice and shifted to 30 "Cforthe specifiedtime. Reactions werethen placed on ice, and duplicate 2 4 aliquots were assayed for ADP formation by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (19).Spontaneous ADP formation was also assayed and subtracted prior to calculations for rates of ATP hydrolysis.The pH and saltconditionsemployed wereoptimizedfor maximalstimulation of Hsp7OsSAlATPase activity by YDJlp. Gel Shift Assay for 12sI-CMLABinding to H~p7@'~'~-Binding reactions were carried out at 30"C for 20 min in 2 0 4 reaction mixtures composed of the following: Hsp70SSA1(2.5-3.0 pM), 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 50 mM NaC1, 10 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.4% bovine serum albumin, and '2sII-CMLA(0.7 p ~4.5, X lo5cpm/pM). The concentrations of indicated reagents were: YDJlp (0-3.4 pM), 2 mMMgC12, 1mM ATP, 1mM AMP-PNP. After incubation, reaction

mixtures were diluted 2-fold with ice-cold 2 X reaction buffer made 20%(v/v) in glyceroland0.01% inbromophenolblue. Diluted samples were loadeddirectly onto a10-15% linear gradient nativegel and run on ice at 10-20mA. After electrophoresis, gelswere immediately fixed, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250,dried, and then used to expose x-ray film. The gel mobility shift of lz5I-CMLA migration was specific for Hsp7OSSA1as bovine serum albumin, YDJlp, and enolase, respectively, at 5 pg/reaction mixture had no effect on CMLA migration. The Hsp70SSA'and lzsII-CMLAconcentrations used are inthe linear range for complex formation. To calculate binding in percent of control bands on the gel corresponding to '"1CMLA and 12sI-CMLA-Hsp70"SA1complexes wereexcised from the dried gel andassayed for I2'I by y counting. Under control conditions, an experimental variation in the level of '2sII-CMLA-Hsp70SSAl complex formation was observed,10-30% of 1251-CMLAadded to reaction mixtures formeda complex with Hsp70SSA1. However,no variation in the levelof complex formation was observed in assays of duplicate reaction mixtures on the same gel. The level of complex formation observed has been previously documented in gel filtration assays, which monitor complex formation between other Hsp70 homologs and CMLA (5, 20). CMLA Zodin~tion-~~~I-CMLAwas made by labeling 100 pgof carboxymethylated lactalbumin (CMLA, Sigma) with 0.5mCiof carrier-free NaI (ICN) using IODO-GEN (Pierce Chemical Co.) as describedby the manufacturer. RESULTS PurifiedHsp7OandYDJlpused in this studywereobtained fromtwodifferentsources.An Hsp7Ofraction highlyenriched in SSAlp (Hsp70SSA') waspurified from S. cerevisiae strain MW141, which was genetically engineered to constitutively expressonly SSA1,and not the other threeSSA genes, which encodecytosolic Hsp7O homologs (6). YDJlp wasoverexpressedand purified fromE. coli. YDJlp is farnesylatedin S. cerevisiae(16),but since E. coli lack protein isoprenyl transferases, purified YDJlp used in this study was not farnesylated. Both protein preparations were greater than 98%pure (Fig. 1). To testfor interactions between Hsp70SSA'and YDJlp, the influenceof YDJlp on Hsp70SSA'ATPase activity was determined. Hsp70SSA' hydrolyzed ATP at a rate of2-5 nmol/mg/ min depending on the protein preparation. These rates are typicalof other Hsp7Ohomologs(4,18,21). YDJlpexhibited nodetectableATPaseactivity(notshown). However,addition of YDJlp toreaction mixtures stimulated Hsp70SSA'ATPase activity approximately 10-foldat all time points tested (Fig. 2A). The -fold stimulation of Hsp70SSA'ATPase activity by YDJlp was constant over a range of ATP concentrations which wereabove and below the K,,, of Hsp70SSA'forATP (approximately2.5 phi).Thus,YDJlp influencesthe maximal velocity of the ATPase reaction and not the affinity of Hsp70SSA'for ATP (Fig. 2B).

FIG.1. Analysis of purified YDJlp and Hsp7OSSA1by SDSPAGE. Respectiveproteins (1.5 pg) were run on a 12.5%polyacrylamide mini-geland thegel stained with CoomassieBrilliant Blue R250. Lane I, molecular mass markers (givenin kDa);lane 2, YDJlp; lane 3, Hsp7OsSA1. shown), indicating that the native conformation of YDJlp must be recognized in order for the two proteins to interact productively. Conformationalchanges in Hsp7O due to ATP hydrolysis have beencorrelatedwith release of bound polypeptides from Hsp70 homologs (1,18,21, 22). To test the influence of the ATPasestimulatorymolecule,YDJlp, on polypeptide binding to Hsp70SSA1,a gel shiftassaywas developedto monitorstable interactions betweenHsp70SSA'and polypeptide substrates. Sincethe affinity of Hsp7O for native proteins is low (20,22), reduced and carboxymethylated a-lactalbumin (CMLA), which is permanently unfolded,waslabeledwith 1251and utilized as a substrate (5, 20). 1251-CMLA migrated with high mobilityon a native polyacrylamide gels(Fig. 3A, lane 1). Incubation with YDJlp had no influence on '251-CMLAmigration (Fig. 3A, lane l versus 2).However, incubation with Hsp70SSA'shifted migrationof '251-CMLAto a position coincident to that of Hsp70SSA',indicating the proteins form a stable complex(Fig. 3A, lane 1 versus 3). '251-CMLA-Hsp70 complexformationwas essentiallyunchangedin the presence of ATP or YDJlp alone (Fig. 3A, lane 3 versus 4 and 6). Hsp70SSA'-CMLAcomplex formation byover70%.When ATP was replaced by AMP-PNP, a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, YDJlp had no significant influence on '251-CMLAHsp7Ocomplex formation (Fig.3, lune 3 versusB), indicating that YDJlp-dependent reductionsin complexformationwere coupled to ATP hydrolysis. To determineif YDJlp stimulatesreleaseof pre-bound1251CMLA fromHsp70SSA'*binding assays were carried out in two steps. In the first step Hsp70SSA'and '251-CMLAwere incubatedto allow complexformation.In thesecondstep,the reaction mixture containing the '251-CMLA-Hsp70SSA'complex was split and incubated further. Addition of ATP to the secondreactionresultedin releaseof 20% ofthe CMLAbound to Hsp70SSA'p inthe first reaction (Fig. 3B, lane 1 versus 2), whereas addition of YDJlp had no effect. Inclusion of both YDJlp andATP in the second incubation resulted in dissociation of 60%of the complex (Fig.3B,lane 1versus4).Thus, the combination of YDJlp and ATP not only prevents substrate binding to Hsp70SSA1 (Fig. 3A) but can also can stimulate substrate release fromthe molecule. CMLA is an artificial substrate ofHsp7O and not capable of foldingafter release fromthe chaperone.This promptedus totest an alternative substrate for binding to Hsp70SSA'.

FIG.3. YDJlp stimulates CMLA-Hsp70SSA'complex dissociation. A, gel shift analysis of "51-CMLA-Hsp70SsA1complex formation. Hsp70SSA'(2.5 pM) and '*'I-CMLA (0.7 pM,4.5 X lo5cpm/ PM) were incubated with the indicated additions at 30 "C for 20 min. Complex formation was analyzed by electrophoresis of reaction mixtures on 10-15% linear gradient native gels (see "Experimental Procedures" for details). CMLA denotes the migration of"'I-CMLA in the absence of Hsp70. Asterisk (*) marks the migration of a radiolabeled contaminant in the "'I-CMLA preparation. The intensity of the * band was constant under all assay conditions. Hsp70-CMLA denotes migration of '"I-CMLA to a position on the gel coincident to thatof Hsp70 as determined by staining gels with Coomassie Blue R-250 prior to autoradiography. 100% of control binding represents 10% of the total "'I-CMLA added to reaction mixtures (lane 3). R, YDJlp stimulates polypeptide release from Hsp7PSA'.For this experiment reactions were carried out in atwo-step process. First, Hsp70 (3.0 pM) and "'I-CMLA (0.4 pM, 4.5 X lo5Cpm/pM) were incubated in an 80-pl reaction mixture at 30 "C for 20 min to allow '2sI-CMLA-Hsp70"A1 complex formation. Aliquots (15 pl) of the initial reaction mixturewere then removed and incubated in a second 20-pl reaction mixture, with indicated additions, for 20 min at 30 "C and thenanalyzed for complex formation as described above. Control assays show that the level of '*'I-CMLA -Hsp70""' complex in Fig. 3 8 (lune I) is the same as thatobserved when complex formation is assayed immediately after the firstincubation. Therefore changes in the levels of complex observed areresultant from a shift in the equlibrium of the binding reaction in response to addition of ATP or the combination of ATP and YDJlp.100%of control binding represents 29% of thetotal "'I-CMLA added to reactionmixtures For details pertaining to the composition of reaction mixtures see "Experimental Procedures."

To establish the specificity of '251-CMLA-Hsp70"A' complex formation, unlabeled competitor CMLA was included in reactions to determine if the levelof CMLAbound to Hsp7OSSA'couldbe reducedbelow that measured in the presence of YDJlp and ATP (Fig. 4A, lane 2). At a 100-foldmolar excess of unlabeled CMLA, the Hsp70SSA'-CMLAcomplexwas reducedto only 22% of control valves. This was the same level of residual binding observed

Hsp70SSA'but asa regulator. 1)Stoichiometrydata (Figs. 1C and 4B) indicate that equamolar YDJlp concentrations are required to stimulate ATP hydrolysis maximallyand also to reduce polypeptide-Hsp70SSA' complexformation.2) YDJlpdependent reduction of Hsp70-CMLA complexformationrequires ATP hydrolysis (Fig.3A). 3) YDJlp stimulates ATPdependent release of substrates pre-bound to Hsp70SSA'.In other independent studies,we observedthat YDJlpdoes not appear to be a general substrate for Hsp7O homologssince it does not stimulate the ATPase activity of purified dnaKp or BIP at concentrations which stimulate Hsp70SSA'ATPase activity maximally.' Furthermore, interactions between YDJlp and Hsp70SSA'donot appear as stable as those between polypeptide substrates and Hsp70SSA' since noalteration in the mobility of ''51-CMLA-Hsp70SSA1 complexis observedon native gelsupon addition of YDJlp to reaction mixtures (Fig. 3A, lane 3 versus 6). The lack of stable YDJlp binding to Hsp70SSA'raises questionsabout the natureof Hsp7Oand dnaJhomolog interHsp7O familymembers to permanently stimulate ATPase activity and cycling onand off polypeptidesubstrates? Alternatively, do dnaJ homologs interact transiently with Hsp70 family membersto stimulate ATP hydrolysisandpolypeptide release at specific subcellular locations wheredischarge of boundpolypeptidesubstratesis required forentry intoprotein foldingor protein translocation pathways? The present data support the alternative. YDJlp stimulates ATP-dependent release of substratespre-boundto Hsp70SSA' (Fig.3B) and is preferentially localizedto membranes (9, 16)where Hsp70 is required to dischargenascent proteins for transport (6-10). Evidence forparticipation of YDJlp in intracellularevents that require Hsp70SSA' comes fromobservationsthat temperature-sensitive mutations in YDJlp cause defects in protein reticulum3at the non-permissivetemperature. These results support observations made here that YDJlp and Hsp70SSA' interact functionally.However, inaddition to stimulatingthe ATPase activity of dnaKp, E. coli dnaJp can bind several protein substrates independent of dnaKp (1,5,24-26) and may actually targetdnaKpto substrates by altering their conformation (3, 24, 25). Therefore, the possibility that YDJlp actsas a chaperone independent of Hsp70SSA'in protein trafficking events cannot beexcludedby data presented here. However, YDJlp does not form a complex with lZ5I-CMLAor other peptide substrates that is stable enough

Hsp70SSA1(2.5pM),12'II-CMLA (0.35 pM, 4.5 X lo5cpm/pM), and unlabeled CMLA (as indicated) were incubated at 30 "C for 20 min. Assay for binding of"'1-CMLA to Hsp70SSA1was carried outas described in the legend to Fig. 3A. 1251-CMLAand unlabeled CMLA behave identically on native gels. CMLA at 10pglreaction mixture was 33 pM.

Thisindicatesthat theHsp70SSA'-CMLA complex, which was

resistant to YDJlp andATP, results from nonspecificinteractions. To correlate stimulation of Hsp70SSA'ATPase activity by YDJlp (Fig.2) with decreasesin specificsubstratebindingto Hsp70SSA',the ratio of YDJlp toHsp70SSA1 requiredto maximallyreduce'251-CMLA-Hsp70SSA'complexformation was determined (Fig. 4B). When the nonspecific association of lZ5I-CMLAto Hsp70SSA1wassubtracted, YDJlp and ATP reducedspecific substrate binding by 90% at a YDJlp: Hsp70SSA' molarratio similar to that observed for maximal stimulation of ATP hydrolysis byYDJlp (Fig.4B). DISCUSSION

to withstand electrophoresison native gels (Fig. 3A, lane 2). Thisisnot surprising,sincegelfiltration experimentsindicate that dnaJpdoes not bind to linear substrates such as CMLA but does bind proteins exhibiting tertiary structure such as folding intermediates of rhodanese (5). We are currently attempting to determine if YDJlp binds to proteins competent for folding. The stability of Hsp70SSA'-CMLA complexes observed here in the presence of ATP (Fig. 3, A and B) is noteworthy since experiments with the other Hsp7O homologs dnaKp, Hsc73, and BIPhave shownthat inclusion of ATP alone in reaction mixtures is sufficient to release the majority of bound substrate (5,20-22).Tightbindingofpolypeptides inthepresence of ATP may reflecta specialization of Hsp70SSA'that allows

large differences inthe activity of different Hsp7O homologs. In yeast, there is evidence for specializationof the different cytosolicdnaJp homologsas SISl and YDJldeletion strains exhibit different phenotypes (9-11). YDJlp is farnesylated posttranslationally, whereas SISlp is not (11, 16). Results reported here demonstrate that YDJlp stimulates release of polypeptide substrates fromHsp70SSA' through stimulation of ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 3, A and B). This is in contrast to a recent report in which E. coli dnaJp was found to stabilizesubstrate binding to dnaKp (5).Langer et al.(5) proposethatdnaJp, which stimulatesdnaKpATPaseactivity about 2-fold (4), acts to stabilize dnaKp-polypeptide complexesby drivingthe conversionof ATP-dnaKp complexesto ADP-dnaKp-complexes, which have higheraffinity for polypeptide substrates (20).Since grpEp was found to stimulate dissociationof dnaKp-dnaJp-polypeptidecomplexes (5),nucleotide exchange catalyzed bygrpEp was presumed to promote polypeptide release by stimulating rounds of ATP hydrolysis (4). In preliminarycomparisons of polypeptidebinding to Hsp70SSA1no increase in the level of stable complex formation was observed when ADP wassubstituted for ATP in binding reactions. Furthermore, addition of ATP and YDJlp to reaction mixtures containing Hsp70SSA'-polypeptide complexesformed in the presence of ADP resulted in complex dissociationsimilar to thatobserved inFig. 3B (not shown).This result indicatesthat ATP hydrolysisstimulated
