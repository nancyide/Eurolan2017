The yeast protein Set1p, inactivation of which alleviates telomeric position effect (TPE), contains a conserved SET domain present in chromosomal proteins involved in epigenetic control of of protein domains in chromatin regulators. One of the most conserved domains is a region of 130 residues known as the SET domain, which has been identified in more than 30 proteins from

transcription1­2. Mec3p is required for efficient DNA-damage- fungi, plant and mammalian species2,10­14. Recently, the 1,081-

dependent checkpoints at G1/S, intra-S and G2/M (refs 3-7). We show here that the SET domain of Set1p interacts with Mec3p. Deletion of SET1 increases the viability of mec3 mutants after DNA damage (in a process that is mostly independent of Rad53p kinase, which has a central role in checkpoint control8­9) but does not significantly affect cell-cycle progression. Deletion of MEC3 enhances TPE and attenuates the set1induced silencing defect. Furthermore, restoration of TPE in a set1 mutant by overexpression of the isolated SET domain requires Mec3p. Finally, deletion of MEC3 results in telomere elongation, whereas cells with deletions of both SET1 and MEC3 do not have elongated telomeres. Our findings indicate that interactions between SET1 and MEC3 have a role in DNA repair and telomere function. residue Set1 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, containing a carboxy-terminal SET domain, was shown to function both in transcriptional telomeric silencing and as a transcriptional activator1. We investigated the role of Set1p using the yeast twohybrid system to identify genes encoding proteins that interact with the SET domain of Set1p (aa 914-1,081; ref. 15). The SET domain of Set1p interacts with the C-terminal region of Mec3p (aa 324-474; Fig. 1a); this interaction is specific for the SET domain of Set1p, as the C-terminal region of Mec3p was unable to interact with the SET domain of trithorax (aa 3,735-3,870 of mouse Mll; Fig. 1a). To confirm the Mec3p-Set1p interaction, we expressed full-length Mec3p fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) as well as the isolated SET domain in Escherichia coli and analysed the ability of the proteins to interact in vitro.

Proteins from the indicated strains were immunoprecipitated with anti-MYC antibodies (anti-MYC IP). Immunoblots were developed with either antiMYC (left) or anti-SET (right) antibodies. The amount of total cell extract revealed by the anti-SET antibodies (right) corresponds to the amount of extract with which the immunoprecipitation was carried out. Nuclei were loaded to identify Set1p.

This protein was absent when we intra-S and G2/M checkpoints8,16. After sporulation of the performed co-immunoprecipitation using cells lacking Set1p diploid, we analysed the sensitivity of spores to DNA-damaging (Fig. 1e) or cells expressing Mec3p without the

MYC9 tag (data not shown). Set1p was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with Mec3p, as we found that approximately 50% of total Set1p associated with Mec3p in the immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1e). These results indicate that Set1p physically interacts with Mec3p in yeast cells. MEC3 is required together with RAD9, RAD17, RAD24 and DDC1 to arrest cell division after DNA damage at G1/S and G2/M, and the same genes are probably involved in repair and/or processing of DNA lesions16. As a mec3 mutant is sensitive to DNA-damaging agents, we tested the sensitivity of a set11 mutant (in which Set1p is interrupted after aa 332) to DNA-damaging agents to assess the functional consequences of the interaction between Set1p and Mec3p. We found that the set11 mutant had a similar resistance to ultraviolet and -irradiation, which induce different types of DNA lesions, as the isogenic wild-type strain (Fig. 2). We then tested the sensitivity of a set11 mec3 double mutant and observed an increase of the viability of set11 mec3 compared with mec3 after ultraviolet and -ray treatments (Fig. 2). We next investigated whether this effect of set11 was specific for the mec3 strain. We introduced the set11 allele into rad9, rad17 and rad24 strains and tested the sensitivity of each double mutant to DNA-damaging agents. The rad9 set11, rad17 set11 and rad24 set11

much faster than wild-type or set11 cells (Fig. 3b). When we released mec3 set11 cells from nocodazole arrest after ultraviolet irradiation, we did not detect any significant delay in mitosis following irradiation (Fig. 3b). Our results indicate that deletion of SET1 does not significantly restore the ability of mec3 mutants to delay cell-cycle progression after DNA damage. set1-null mutants lack the ability to silence a reporter gene inserted near a telomere; this TPE defect is rescued by overexpression of the isolated SET domain of Set1p (ref. 1). To assess whether MEC3 interferes with the functions of SET1 in TPE, we used a series of strains (derived from LPY917) in which the fragmented chromosome VII-L carries a subtelomeric URA3 reporter gene18. Cells with a repressed URA3 were identified as those able to form colonies in the presence of 5-fluoro-orotic acid (FOA) and URA3 expression was estimated by the fraction of normal-sized colonies growing on a synthetic medium without uracil18. As expected, URA3 was derepressed in cells with disruption of SET1 at aa 40 (set12::HIS3), as revealed by the absence of colonies on FOA plates (Fig. 4a) and an increased proportion of cells able to form colonies on minimal media without uracil (Fig. 4b). Disruption of MEC3 (mec3::TRP1; ref. 5), but not of RAD24, partially restored TPE in set1 cells, because the viability of mec3 set12 cells on FOA is increased 10-100-fold (Fig. 4a) and the growth on plates without uracil is comparable with that of wild type (Fig. 4b). Deletion of MEC3 alone appears to enhance TPE. The proportion of mec3 cells growing on minimal media -Ura was threefold lower than that of wild-type cells

We examined the sion through S phase. After MMS treatment, we noticed no length of the left telomere of fragmented chromosome VII-L, detectable differences in the rate of progression through S phase which carries a URA3 reporter gene18 (Fig. 5). Telomeres from between wild type and set11 and between mec3 and mec3 set1 cells are slightly shorter1 (40 bp), comparable with those set11 (data not shown).

rif2), suggesting that MEC3 is involved in these pathways. As abnormally long telomeres can hyper-repress telomere-adjacent genes22, the enhanced TPE observed in mec3 cells could be a direct consequence of the modification of telomere length. The deletion of SET1 in mec3 cells brings telomere length to a size similar to that found in set1 cells. It is plausible therefore that the target regulated by MEC3 in telomere replication requires SET1. This suggests MEC3 and SET1 may have opposing roles in the activity of one or several telomeric components. Finally, in contrast to mec3 cells, rad24 and rad24 set1 cells do not have elongated telomeres but rather display slightly shorter telomeres. Indeed, telomere shortening has been observed for Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells defective in rad17, the S. pombe homologue of RAD24 (ref. 23). SET1 and/or MEC3 might have indirect roles at telomeres and in DNA repair by regulating the expression of other genes involved in these processes. Set1p has been proposed to be a general transcriptional regulator that positively regulates genes involved in DNA replication and/or repair, such as replication factor C or the putative helicase Has1p (ref. 1). The data presented in this study, however, are in favour of direct recruitment of Mec3p and Set1p at telomeres and at sites of DNA damage. The evidence is as follows: using several assays, the SET domain of Set1p was shown to directly interact with Mec3p in vitro and in vivo; SET1 influences the function of MEC3, RAD17, RAD24 and RAD9 in DNA repair, but

In view of the interactions between Set1p and Mec3p demonstrated in this study, it is possible that other SET domain proteins may be found to interact with checkpoint proteins, revealing new connections between telomeres, chromatin, replication and DNA repair.
