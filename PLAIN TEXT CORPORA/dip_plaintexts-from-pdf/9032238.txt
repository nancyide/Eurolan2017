A Basic Helix-Loop-Helix­Leucine Zipper Transcription Complex in Yeast Functions in a Signaling Pathway from Mitochondria to the Nucleus

YANKAI JIA, BEVERLY ROTHERMEL, JANET THORNTON, AND RONALD A. BUTOW* Department of Molecular Biology and Oncology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75235 Received 6 September 1996/Returned for modification 17 October 1996/Accepted 4 December 1996 The expression of some nuclear genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, such as the CIT2 gene, which encodes a glyoxylate cycle isoform of citrate synthase, is responsive to the functional state of mitochondria. Previous studies identified a basic helix-loop-helix­leucine zipper (bHLH/Zip) transcription factor encoded by the RTG1 gene that is required for both basal expression of the CIT2 gene and its increased expression in respiratorydeficient cells. Here, we describe the cloning and characterization of RTG3, a gene encoding a 54-kDa bHLH/ Zip protein that is also required for CIT2 expression. Rtg3p binds together with Rtg1p to two identical sites oriented as inverted repeats 28 bp apart in a regulatory upstream activation sequence element (UASr) in the CIT2 promoter. The core binding site for the Rtg1p-Rtg3p heterodimer is 5 -GGTCAC-3 , which differs from the canonical E-box site, CANNTG, to which most other bHLH proteins bind. We demonstrate that both of the Rtg1p-Rtg3p binding sites in the UASr element are required in vivo and act synergistically for CIT2 expression. The basic region of Rtg3p conforms well to the basic region of most bHLH proteins, whereas the basic region of Rtg1p does not. These findings suggest that the Rtg1p-Rtg3p complex interacts in a novel way with its DNA target sites.

Cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are able to monitor and respond to changes in mitochondrial function through accommodating changes in nuclear gene expression (26). We have referred to this process as retrograde regulation, which can be thought of as a stress response to mitochondrial dysfunctions (reviewed by Shyjan and Butow [36]). One example of retrograde regulation is the elevated expression of the CIT2 gene in response to various mitochondrial lesions (17). CIT2 encodes a peroxisomal isoform of citrate synthase (CS2) (15, 21) that functions in the glyoxylate cycle. CS2 has 83% sequence similarity with the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle isoform of citrate synthase, CS1, encoded by the CIT1 gene. Various mitochondrial lesions, such as a block in the TCA cycle or the loss of mitochondrial DNA, result in a transcriptional activation of CIT2 anywhere from 2- to 30-fold. This activation is dependent, in part, on the kind mitochondrial defect (4, 17). We have suggested that the corresponding increases in CS2 activity could compensate for decreases in TCA cycle activity (17) through the known metabolic interactions between the glyoxylate and TCA cycles (38). We have identified two genes, RTG1 and RTG2, that are central to this novel signaling pathway (16). Each is required for basal as well as retrograde-regulated CIT2 expression. Surprisingly, both RTG1 and RTG2 are also essential for peroxisome proliferation (4, 13), which can be induced in yeast cells by the presence of oleic acid in the growth medium (14, 37, 40). RTG1 and RTG2 are also required for the oleic acid-dependent increase in expression of POX genes (encoding enzymes of the -oxidation pathway) and PMP27, which encodes a protein associated with peroxisomal membranes (20).

ever, unlike the case for the CIT2 gene, there is no indication that the promoter activities of these other genes encoding peroxisomal proteins are directly influenced by the RTG genes. We have suggested that the RTG genes may act early in the pathway of oleic acid-induced biogenesis of peroxisomes (4). This provocative link between mitochondria, peroxisomes, and the nucleus suggests that retrograde regulation is a fundamental process of organelle communication that functions to coordinate metabolic activities in response to changes in the functional state of mitochondria. RTG1 encodes a 19-kDa protein that is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix­leucine zipper (bHLH/Zip) family of transcription factors (7, 23­25). Proteins of this class contain (i) a basic DNA binding domain followed by two helix regions separated by a loop of variable length and (ii) a leucine zipper domain that contributes an interface for dimerization. Rtg1p is unusual for a number of reasons: it has a truncated basic domain compared with most other members of the bHLH/Zip family of proteins; and its basic domain also lacks a number of conserved amino acid residues that, from crystal structure analysis of several bHLH/Zip proteins, function in contacting the canonical E-box DNA target site for bHLH proteins, CANNTG (6, 7, 19). Rtg1p also has an unusually long loop domain (some 39 amino acids) separating the two helical regions. Finally, Rtg1p binds to DNA sequences contained within a 76-bp regulatory upstream activation sequence (UASr) element in the 5 flanking region of CIT2 that are necessary and sufficient for basal and retrograde-regulated expression of CIT2 but which lack an E box. Thus, Rtg1p is likely to interact in a novel way with its CIT2 UASr target site. bHLH and bHLH/Zip transcription factors activate gene expression as either homo- or heterodimers through oligomerization interfaces contained in the HLH and Zip domains (reviewed in reference 5). We have recently shown that a chimeric protein, in which the DNA binding domain of the transcriptional regulator protein GAL4 was fused to Rtg1p,

VOL. 17, 1997 can transactivate expression of a reporter gene construct containing the GAL4 target site (UASG) fused to the Escherichia coli lacZ gene (32). Moreover, the GAL4-Rtg1p fusion transactivated in a retrograde-responsive manner; i.e., activity was greater in respiratory-incompetent [rho0] cells lacking mitochondrial DNA than in wild-type [rho ] cells. An important conclusion from those studies was that Rtg1p does not itself contain an activation domain but must interact with an unidentified protein, most likely another bHLH protein, which together are required for [rho ]-[rho0] retrograde-responsive CIT2 expression. Analysis of the RTG2-encoded protein (Rtg2p) and DNA binding studies with extracts from cells lacking Rtg2p (16) suggest that Rtg2p, whose function is unknown, is not likely to be a transcription factor and thus not the Rtg1p activation partner. Here we describe the cloning and characterization of a third gene, RTG3, required for CIT2 expression. RTG3 encodes a 54-kDa bHLH/Zip protein. Unlike Rtg1p, Rtg3p contains those amino acid residues in its basic region that are conserved among most other bHLH proteins and which are known to contact specific bases in an E-box DNA target site. Nevertheless, we show that Rtg1p and Rtg3p are required together to bind to each of two identical non-E-box core sequences, 5 -G GTCAC-3 , in the 76-bp CIT2 UASr. These sites, which are duplicated as an inverted repeat separated by 28 bp of an AT-rich sequence, act synergistically to effect CIT2 expression in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS Yeast strains and growth conditions. The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are derivatives of strain COP161 U7 (MAT ade1 lys1 ura3). The rtg1 and rtg2 gene replacement strains were described previously (16). Ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis was carried out as previously described (16) to generate the mutant rtg3-1. A lacZ reporter gene, in which 607 bp of the 5 flanking region of CIT2 fused to the E. coli lacZ gene, was integrated into the URA3 locus as described by Liao and Butow (16). A rtg3 strain was made by replacing codons 175 to 340 with the URA3 gene by standard transformation procedures (31) and confirmed by Southern blot analysis. All strains exist as [rho ] and [rho0] derivatives. The [rho0] derivatives were obtained by several passages of [rho ] cells through YPD medium containing 20 g of ethidium bromide per ml. Cells were grown at 30 C on YP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto Peptone) and either 2% glucose (YPD), 2% raffinose (YPR), or 2% glycerol (YPG) as a carbon source. Selective YNB medium contained 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% dextrose (YNBD), 2% raffinose (YNBR), or 2% potassium acetate (YNBAc) as a carbon source, supplemented with Casamino Acids or with individual amino acids as required. Cloning and sequencing of RTG3 and rtg3-1. Two plasmids encoding wild-type RTG3 were identified from a genomic library, 8979-3A (30) as described in Results. RTG3 was initially subcloned as a 4.2-kb fragment by phenotypic complementation. Two HindIII fragments of 1.4 and 2.8 kb were then subcloned into pUC19. A set of nested exonuclease III deletions was generated from each of the fragments. Both strands of each fragment were sequenced by using a Sequenase kit (U.S. Biochemical). The junction of the two fragments and the gaps among the deletions were sequenced by using oligonucleotide primers. To sequence the rtg3-1 mutant allele, we cloned a 1.8-kb PCR fragment amplified from rtg3-1 genomic DNA in pGem-3Zf( ) (Promega). Three independent clones were sequenced. Northern blot and RNase protection analysis. Strains were precultured in selective medium to maintain either a control plasmid, YCp50, or YCp50 containing an insert of a genomic DNA fragment encoding RTG3. Precultures were used to inoculate YPR cultures at an optical density at 600 nm of 0.02 and grown to mid-logarithmic phase. Total cellular RNA was isolated by the procedure of Schmitt et al. (34), fractionated on 1.2% agarose gels, and transferred to Nytran Plus membranes essentially as described in reference (33). CIT2 and actin probes were labeled with [ -32P]ATP by using a Random Primed DNA Labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Blots were hybridized in 0.5 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.4)­7% sodium dodecyl sulfate­1% bovine serum albumin­1 mM EDTA at 65 C. Hybridization signals were quantified with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. RNase protection analysis of CIT2 and actin mRNA levels was carried out on total RNA preparations essentially as described by Liao and Butow (16). For RTG3 mRNA analysis, a fragment encoding amino acids 375 through 486 of Rtg3p was cloned into the EcoRI and PstI sites of pGEM-3Zf( ), using PCR primers to generate the required restriction sites. This plasmid was linearized

with BstEII and SP6 RNA polymerase was used to generate a 196-bp riboprobe. Total cellular RNA was isolated from log-phase cultures of COP161 U7 [rho ] and [rho0] cells grown on YPR. Preparation of recombinant Rtg1p and Rtg3p. The open reading frames of RTG1 and RTG3 were amplified by PCR and cloned in frame into the pMAL-cII vector (New England Biolabs). The recombinant plasmids were expressed in E. coli, and the proteins were purified on a maltose affinity column as instructed by the manufacturer. The fusion proteins were cleaved with factor Xa. A sample of the products was fractionated on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and then stained with Coomassie blue to verify the cleavage products. EMSA. Whole-cell extracts were prepared as described previously (16). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were carried out as described by Rothermel et al. (32). These assays are modified from those originally reported by Liao and Butow (16) so that two rather that three gel-shifted bands are observed when the 76-bp CIT2 UASr probe is incubated with extracts from [rho ] or from [rho0] cells. The 76-bp CIT2 UASr was amplified by PCR. Complementary oligonucleotides spanning the A and A sites (see Fig. 5A) were annealed to form the 21- and 23-bp double-stranded DNA fragments by standard nase (Boehringer Mannheim). DNA fragments were incubated with recombinant proteins or cell extracts in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)­100 mM KCl­4 g of denatured single-stranded salmon sperm DNA­2 mM MgCl2­5% glycerol at 25 C for 20 min. The reaction mixture was fractionated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel at 4 C for 2 h. The gel was dried and exposed to X-ray film. Oligonucleotides used for PCR and EMSA templates are listed in Table 1. UASr-lacZ constructs and -galactosidase assays. Plasmid p76AA contains the 76-bp UASr from CIT2 upstream of a minimal CYC1 TATA element driving a lacZ reporter cloned in the centromere-based URA3 plasmid, pBL101, as previously described (32). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to change GGT CAC to GGTACC in the A element of the 76 bp UASr to produce p76XA . A GTGACC-to-GGTACC change in the A element was made to construct p76AX . Plasmid p76XX contains both sets of changes. p21A contains the sequence 5 -GCGAAGACCTCACGACCTATT-3 with a single Rtg1p-Rtg3p binding site linked to the CYC1 TATA. p76AA , p76XA , p76AX , p76XX , and p21A were transformed into COP161U7 cells and rtg3 [rho ] and [rho0] cells. Precultures of 15 to 20 pooled transformants were grown on selective medium to maintain the plasmids. Oligonucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis are listed in Table 1. Precultures were used to inoculate YNBR cultures at a low density. Mid-logarithmic-phase cultures were harvested and assayed in triplicated for -galactosidase activity as previously described (16). Plasmids were maintained at 95%. RESULTS Identification of RTG3. To identify new genes in the CIT2 retrograde pathway, we took advantage of a strategy used previously to identify RTG1 and RTG2 (16). Briefly, the procedure involves the rescue by complementation with a wildtype yeast genomic library of mutants defective in expression of a lacZ reporter gene fused to the CIT2 promoter. Because CIT2 expression is greater in [rho0] petite cells than in [rho ] wild-type cells, the mutant screen and subsequent cloning experiments were carried out with a [rho0] derivative of strain COP161U7. This strain was transformed with a centromerebased plasmid containing a 607-bp fragment of the 5 noncoding region of CIT2 fused to the E. coli lacZ gene. On 5-bromo4-chloro-3-indolyl- -D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) plates, colonies of this otherwise wild-type transformant stain blue. Cells were mutagenized with ethyl methanesulfonate to yield 40% survivors and screened for colonies that were white on X-Gal plates. This screen yielded five independent mutants whose white-colony phenotype was not plasmid linked. The CIT2-lacZ reporter construct was then integrated into the URA3 locus of each of the mutants. Following selection of the Ura transformants on plates containing 5-fluoroorotic acid, these mutants were transformed with a YCp50 vector containing either RTG1 (YCpRTG1) or RTG2 (YCpRTG2) to determine whether any of the mutants were due to mutations in RTG1 or RTG2. YCpRTG2 restored a blue-colony phenotype to four of the mutants, and none was restored to a blue-colony phenotype with YCpRTG1. Subsequent experiments revealed that the one mutant strain not rescued by either YCpRTG1 or YCpRTG2 was due to a single-gene mutation, which we have designated rtg3-1.

To clone the wild-type allele of rtg3-1, we transformed mutant cells with a YCp50-based wild-type yeast genomic library (30) and screened for colonies that were blue on X-Gal plates. From this screen, we obtained two colonies whose blue phenotype was plasmid linked; further analysis showed that the two restoring YCp50 plasmids contained overlapping inserts. The complementing function that could restore a blue-colony phenotype to the mutant strain was subcloned to a 4.2-kb insert and sequenced. RTG3 encodes a bHLH/Zip transcription factor. DNA sequence analysis revealed a single open reading frame within the insert encoding a 486-amino-acid protein, hereafter called Rtg3p. The open reading frame corresponds to the region YBL103C (GenBank accession number U46012). Rtg3p contains sequence motifs characteristic of the bHLH/Zip family of transcription factors (Fig. 1) such as Max (3) and Mad (1). Unlike the case for Rtg1p, however, the basic domain of Rtg3p conforms closely to that of other bHLH proteins; in particular, it contains residues such as Arg287, His290, and Glu294 (Fig. 1B), which are highly conserved among bHLH proteins and which have been shown to make specific base or phosphate backbone contacts in the major groove of the canonical E-box binding site, CANNTG. Rtg3p also contains a relatively high proportion of Ser and Thr residues (19%), the majority of which are located in the amino-terminal half of the protein, before the bHLH motif (Fig. 1A). Finally, we have sequenced

FIG. 2. RTG3 is required for CIT2 expression. Total cellular RNA was isolated from logarithmic-phase cultures of wild-type (WT) or rtg3 mutant [rho ] and [rho0] derivatives of strain COP161U7 grown on YPR medium. Cells were transformed with a control YCp50 plasmid or a plasmid (YCpRTG3) containing the RTG3 gene as indicated. The Northern blots were hybridized with probes specific for CIT2 and actin mRNAs as described in Materials and Methods.

three independently cloned PCR products of the mutant rtg3-1 allele and determined that the mutation is a C955-to-T transition creating a UAG stop codon at amino acid position 153. Rtg3p is required for CIT2 expression. To assess the control of RTG3 on CIT2 expression, we performed Northern blot analysis of CIT2 mRNA abundance in total RNA from [rho ] and [rho0] COP161U7 cells containing either a wild-type or a mutant allele of RTG3. In these experiments, we analyzed both the original rtg3-1 mutant and a deletion mutant ( rtg3) in which codons 175 to 340 of the RTG3 reading frame were replaced by the URA3 gene. We note that rtg3 haploid cells were viable on YPD medium and that both the rtg3-1 and rtg3 mutants could grow on glycerol and retain a [rho ] mitochondrial genome during growth on fermentable carbon sources. Figure 2, lanes 1 and 2, shows a typical retrograde response of the CIT2 gene, where the abundance of CIT2 mRNA is greater in [rho0] than in [rho ] cells. Lanes 3 to 5 show that CIT2 mRNA is not detected in the original rtg3-1 [rho0] mutant or in [rho ] or [rho0] rtg3 cells transformed with the YCp50 vector alone. However, CIT2 mRNA abundance is again restored to wild-type levels in both [rho ] and [rho0] cells transformed with YCpRTG3. After correction for the abundance of actin mRNA, the abundance of CIT2 mRNA is four- to fivefold greater in the [rho0] transformants than in the [rho ] transformants. From these experiments, we conclude that RTG3, like RTG1 and RTG2, is required for expression of the

76-bp CIT2 UASr, using extracts from wild-type and mutant rtg1 and rtg3 cells in EMSA. Figure 4A, lane 2, shows that extracts from wild-type cells yielded two prominent gel-retarded bands, A and B. Band B is the Rtg1p-specific complex, since it was not detected with extracts from rtg1 cells (lane 3). We also were unable to detect band B with extracts from either rtg3 or rtg3-1 cells (lanes 4 and 5), indicating that Rtg3p also binds to the UASr and is part of the same protein-DNA complex as Rtg1p. The preceding observations suggest that Rtg1p and Rtg3p may interact as a heterodimer at their target site(s) in the CIT2 UASr. To examine this possibility, we used purified recombinant Rtg1p and Rtg3p in a variety of EMSAs. Full-length recombinant Rtg1p and Rtg3p were expressed in E. coli as fusions to the C terminus of the E. coli maltose binding protein, MalE. The fusion proteins were purified from cell extracts and cleaved with factor Xa to separate the MalE protein from Rtg1p and Rtg3p. Figure 4B shows that neither Rtg1p or Rtg3p alone could band shift the 76-bp UASr probe. However, when both proteins were present at roughly equimolar concentrations in the assay, a major gel-retarded band and two slower-migrating species appeared. Finally, as shown by the control in lane 4, no gel-retarded band was obtained in assays using the MalE protein by itself. These data suggest that Rtg1p and Rtg3p interact as a heterodimer to bind to one or more sites in the CIT2 UASr, since neither protein alone appears able to bind to any significant extent to that element. The observation that the mobility of the complexes formed with recombinant Rtg1p and Rtg3p (Fig. 4B) is greater than that of the Rtg1p-Rtg3p-dependent complex seen with extracts from yeast cells (Fig. 4A) suggests the possibility that one or more as yet unidentified proteins are recruited to the 76-bp UASr, perhaps by binding specifically to the heterodimeric complex. Indeed, evidence for such interactions involving bHLH proteins in other systems has been obtained. For example, the activation of muscle-specific genes has been suggested to occur via the formation of a ternary complex between the myocyte enhancer factor 2 and the MyoD-E12 bHLH heterodimer (22). And in yeast, transcriptional repression of the PHO4 bHLH transcription factor results from the masking of its activation by the repressor protein

phenotypes of cells with mutant alleles of RTG1 or RTG2 are the inability to utilize acetate as a sole carbon source and a growth requirement for glutamate or aspartate (16). To determine whether rtg3 mutant cells have phenotypes similar to those of mutant rtg1 and mutant rtg2 cells, we compared the growth requirements of a rtg3 COP161U7 strain transformed with a YCp50 vector alone or with YCpRTG3. As controls, wild-type COP161U7 cells and an rtg1 derivative, transformed either with YCp50 vector alone or with YCpRTG1, were examined in the same experiment. Figure 3 shows that like rtg1 mutant cells, rtg3 mutant cells (transformed with vector alone) were unable to grow on acetate medium and that they required either glutamate or aspartate for growth; these growth phenotypes were restored to wild type in rtg3 cells transformed with YCpRTG3. Rtg1p and Rtg3p are together required for binding to the CIT2 UASr. Previous studies showed that Rtg1p binds to the 76-bp CIT2 UASr element and requires, in addition to Rtg2p, at least one other protein for transactivation (32). The finding that Rtg3p, like Rtg1p, is a bHLH/Zip protein required for CIT2 expression raises the possibility that Rtg3p is the partner protein to Rtg1p. Therefore, we first tested whether Rtg3p is required for Rtg1p-dependent complex formation with the

Rtg1p and Rtg3p bind to the CIT2 UASr. (A) Whole-cell extracts from wild-type (lane 2), rtg1 (lane 3), rtg3 (lane 4), and rtg3-1 (lane 5) COP161U7 cells were prepared and tested in EMSA with the 76-bp UASr as described in Materials and Methods.

PHO80, which binds to residues in PHO4 outside the bHLH domain (10). Further studies will be required to determine if other proteins--coactivators or repressors--interact with the Rtg1p-Rtg3p complex. Rtg1p and Rtg3p bind to a non-E-box site. As already noted, the 76-bp CIT2 UASr element does not contain a canonical bHLH E-box site. It does, however, contain a 7-bp inverted duplication of the sequence 5 -AGGTCAC-3 , designated A and A (Fig. 5A), with the E-box half site, CAC. To test whether the A and A sites might be involved in Rtg1p and Rtg3p binding, we made two double-stranded oligonucleotides, a 21-mer encompassing the A site and a 23-mer encompassing the A site (Fig. 5A). Each was then tested for the ability of recombinant Rtg1p and Rtg3p to bind in EMSA. Figure 5B shows that in the presence of Rtg1p and Rtg3p, both oligonucleotide probes gave rise to gel-retarded bands. As with the 76-bp probe, neither Rtg1p or Rtg3p alone bound to the oligonucleotide probes (not shown). These data suggest that Rtg1p and Rtg3p interact as a complex with at least two sites in the CIT2 UASr encompassed by the oligonucleotides spanning the A and A sites. To define more precisely the sequences to which the Rtg1pRtg3p complex binds, we carried out a series of EMSAs using recombinant proteins and 21-mers containing single-base transversion mutations of the A site as well as flanking base pair mutations. The results of these experiments (Fig. 6) show that single-base mutations of (GTCAC)28­32 abolish binding completely: a G27-to-T mutation reduced binding by about one-half, whereas various flanking mutations had no effect on binding. These experiments thus define a minimum sequence, 5 -GGTCAC-3 , necessary for binding of the Rtg1p-Rtg3p complex. The Rtg1p-Rtg3p binding sites act synergistically in vivo. To establish an in vivo correlate to the sequence requirements for Rtg1p-Rtg3p binding in vitro, and to determine the contribution of each of the binding sites to the in vivo activity of the CIT2 UASr, we made three constructs in which the A and A GGTCAC sites in the UASr were mutated singly and together to GGTACC. As shown in the preceding experiments, each of the single-base transversions blocks binding of the Rtg1p-

Rtg3p complex (Fig. 6, lanes 6 and 7). Similarly, the Rtg1pRtg3p complex is unable to bind to a site with the double mutation (data not shown). To test for in vivo activity of the mutant UASr constructs, we made use of the centromerebased expression plasmid p76AA , which contains the 76-bp UASr linked to a minimal CYC1 TATA element driving the expression of a lacZ reporter gene. Plasmids containing the mutations of the A site (p76XA ), of the A site (p76AX ), and of both sites (p76XX ) were constructed. We also tested the in vivo activity of a single A binding site contained within just the 21-bp sequence used in the preceding EMSAs. Each of the constructs was then transformed into [rho ] and [rho0] COP161U7 cells, and -galactosidase activity was measured in cell extracts. Figure 7 shows that, as previously described (16),

FIG. 7. In vivo activity of mutant Rtg1p-Rtg3p binding sites in the CIT2 UASr. COP161U7 [rho ] and [rho0] cells were transformed with p76AA , p76XA , p76AX , p76XX , or p21A as described in Materials and Methods. Each of the plasmids contained the 76-bp UASr element or 21-mer used in the preceding experiments as indicated, linked to a minimal CYC1 TATA element driving a lacZ reporter gene. The opposite-facing arrows indicate the A and A sites, and the X indicates a mutant site. Logarithmic-phase cultures grown on YNBR supplemented with Casamino Acids were harvested and tested for -galactosidase specific activity.

the wild-type 76-bp UASr (p76AA ) not only supports lacZ expression of a reporter gene but does so in a [rho ]-[rho0]responsive manner. Constructs containing mutations of the upstream site (p76XA ) result in about an 85% inhibition of lacZ expression in both [rho ] and [rho0] cells; mutations of the downstream site (p76AX ) result in a slightly greater (90 to 92%) inhibition of lacZ expression. When both sites are mutant (p76XX ), lacZ expression is inhibited nearly completely. The 21-bp construct containing just the A site and some flanking DNA sequences (Fig. 5A) was inactive. This result is not surprising, since DNA band shift experiments indicate that factors other than Rtg1p and Rtg3p are bound to sites within the UASr and are presumably required for CIT2 expression. From these data, we conclude that both the A and A Rtg1pRtg3p binding sites are required for full [rho ] and [rho0] CIT2 expression and that they act synergistically in transcriptional control. RTG3 expression in [rho ] and [rho0] cells. Because CIT2 transcription is absolutely dependent on Rtg1p and Rtg3p, it is possible that the difference in CIT2 expression between [rho ] and [rho0] cells is due to a change in expression of RTG1 and RTG3. However, in a previous analysis of Rtg1p (30), we could not detect any significant difference in the amount of the protein between [rho ] and [rho0] cells. We have carried out a similar analysis using rabbit polycolonal antibodies raised against recombinant Rtg3p. Although the anti-Rtg3p antiserum can readily detect the recombinant Rtg3p in Western blot analysis, we have been unsuccessful in detecting Rtg3p in extracts from either [rho ] or [rho0] cells (data not shown), suggesting that the abundance of the protein is very low. This view is consistent with the results of Northern blot analysis indicating that the RTG3 mRNA abundance is also very low (data not shown). Therefore, we used a more sensitive RNase protection assay to compare the RTG3 mRNA abundance in [rho ] and [rho0] cells. The results of such an experiment are presented in Fig. 8. Quantification of the protected fragments relative to actin show that RTG3 mRNA is 2-fold greater in [rho0] than in [rho ] cells, whereas the CIT2 mRNA abundance in the same RNA preparations is 6.6-fold greater in

[rho0] cells--a typical retrograde response for the CIT2 gene. Similar results have been obtained in independent experiments of this sort. Clearly, there is not a one-to-one correspondence between RTG3 and CIT2 expression; however, this does not exclude the possibility that a small change in RTG3 expression can be amplified to result in larger changes in CIT2 expression between [rho ] and [rho0] cells. As noted in a previous study (15), we have not detected any difference in the EMSA pattern, either quantitatively or qualitatively, using the 76-bp element as a probe and extracts from [rho ] or [rho0] cells. However, these experiments do not rule out the possibility that mechanisms besides control of the abundance of Rtg1p or Rtg3p can affect the availability of these transcription factors for regulation of CIT2 expression. Experiments are in progress to dissect the control of expression of both RTG1 and RTG3 and the possible relation between expression of these genes and the retrograde response. DISCUSSION Cellular requirements for RTG3. We have isolated and characterized a yeast gene, RTG3, required for basal and retrograde-regulated expression of the CIT2 gene. Mutations of RTG3 have multiple phenotypes, resulting not only in a loss of CIT2 expression but also in an inability of the mutant cells to grow on acetate as a sole carbon source and in the appearance of a growth requirement for glutamate or aspartate (one amino acid will spare the other). These growth phenotypes are characteristic of cells with blocks in both the TCA and glyoxylate cycles (12). Although not presented in this study, mutant alleles of RTG3 are also defective in the induction of peroxisomal proteins (and presumably peroxisome biogenesis) when cells are grown on medium containing oleic acid (3a). These phenotypes are identical to those observed in cells with mutant rtg1 and rtg2 alleles (4). Thus, we can classify RTG3 as an additional member of the retrograde genes in yeast that function in a novel three-way interaction between mitochondria, peroxisomes, and the nucleus. An Rtg1p-Rtg3p bHLH/Zip complex. The open reading frame of RTG3 is predicted to encode a 54-kDa protein with a

The levels of RTG3 and CIT2 mRNAs was carried out by RNase protection on total cellular RNA from wild-type COP161U7 [rho ] and [rho0] cells as described in Materials and Methods. For CIT2 and RTG3, 50 g of total RNA was used in the assay; for actin, 5 g of RNA was used.

centrally situated bHLH/Zip motif that is very similar to the bHLH/Zip domains of transcription factors like Max (3, 7) and Mad (1). In addition, the amino-terminal half of Rtg3p upstream of the bHLH/Zip motif is very rich in serine and threonine residues, suggesting the potential for phosphorylation of the protein. bHLH/Zip transcription factors bind to their DNA target sites as homo- or heterodimers, utilizing dimerization interfaces that include the helix and zipper domains. We previously established that Rtg1p, also a bHLH/Zip protein required for basal and retrograde-regulated expression of CIT2, bound to one or more sites in the 76-bp CIT2 UASr (32). Transactivation studies of reporter gene expression using fusions of the DNA binding domain of GAL4 to different domains of Rtg1p suggested that at least one other (unidentified) protein was required in together with Rtg1p for CIT2 expression. The present study establishes that Rtg3p is the bHLH partner to Rtg1p for binding to the UASr. Using purified full-length recombinant Rtg1p and Rtg3p expressed in E. coli, we have shown that protein-DNA complex formation with the UASr requires both proteins, strongly suggesting that they interact with their DNA target sites as heterodimers or higherorder oligomers. In studies to be presented elsewhere, we have systematically analyzed the transactivation activities of various domains of Rtg3p in fusions to the DNA binding domain of GAL4. These analyses show a strong C-terminal activation domain and a weaker N-terminal activation domain of Rtg3p; neither of these domains, or the full-length Rtg3p, required either Rtg1p or Rtg2p for transactivation, suggesting that these proteins function, at least in part, to recruit Rtg3p to its binding site for transcriptional activation. Detailed structural and crystallographic analyses show that the general mode of binding of bHLH proteins to their DNA target sites is through adjacent major groove contacts. These contacts are between specific amino acid residues in an extended helix consisting of the basic region and helix 1 of each monomer to specific bases and phosphates within the E-box binding site (6, 7). These interactions thus position the helices of each bHLH monomer unit perpendicular to each other on opposite sides of the DNA duplex. Contacts between monomer units are then established through coiled-coil interactions between the first helix of each subunit and the helix 2-Zip domains C-terminal to the loop regions. As elaborated in the following discussion, there are a number of reasons to believe that this general picture will be different for the interaction of the Rtg1p-Rtg3p complex with its target sites in the CIT2 UASr. The Rtg1p-Rtg3p binding site is novel. The E-box DNA recognition site for most bHLH proteins, CANNTG, may be either perfectly symmetric (but differ in bHLH binding specificity, such as CACGTG or CAGCTG) or lack perfect symmetry, such as CACCTG. In any case, a hallmark of the binding of bHLH/Zip proteins to these E boxes is the interaction of the invariant residues of an ERXR motif in the basic domain, as well as conserved His or Thr residues in the basic region, with the DNA (5). Crystal structure analysis shows, for example, invariant contacts between the conserved Glu of the ERXR motif and the CA of each E-box half site (6). Our mutational analysis shows that the minimal binding site for Rtg1p-Rtg3p is 5 -GGTCAC-3 . The CIT2 UASr contains two such sites arranged in opposite orientation, separated by 28 bp of an AT-rich inverted repeat; both sites bind the Rtg1pRtg3p complex and both are required for full expression of CIT2 in vivo. The GGTCAC binding site, which we propose to call an R box, differs from the canonical bHLH E-box site in two obvious ways: it lacks dyad symmetry and it does not have a CA at its 5 end. The location of the CAC at the 3 end of the

MOL. CELL. BIOL. minimal hexanucleotide binding site poses interesting considerations of how the R box might be contacted by the Rtg1pRtg3p complex. Given the conserved Glu294, Arg287, and His290 residues in the basic region of Rtg3p that in other bHLH proteins contact the CA/GT of the E-box half site in the major groove, it is likely that the basic-helix 1 domain of Rtg3p is also positioned in the major groove, interacting with the CAC half site of the R box. The conserved Glu appears to be an important feature of the contact between the basic region of bHLH proteins and the CA of the symmetric E box because substitutions of that amino acid generally impair DNA binding (8, 9). Clearly, mutations of the CAC as well as the upstream GGT bases influence the binding of the Rtg1p-Rtg3p complex, whereas mutations of bases immediately downstream of the CAC have no effect (Fig. 6). Two exceptions to the consensus bHLH­E-box binding are the SREB/ADD1 protein, which is involved in transcriptional regulation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor and in adipocyte differentiation (11, 39, 42), and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (ARH)-aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translator protein (ARNT) bHLH heterodimeric complex that functions in xenobiotic metabolism (27­29, 41). SREB/ADD1 is a bHLH protein that can recognize both E-box and non-E-box sites. In the latter case, a SREB/ADD1 homodimer binds to the site 5 -CACCCCAC-3 , which, although not an E box, contains a direct repeat of an E-box half site. A critical feature of the basic region of SREB/ADD1 that may accommodate binding to both E-box site and non-E-box sites is the substitution of a Tyr for the conserved Arg in the basic region of the protein (11). We have, in preliminary experiments, tested whether the recombinant Rtg1p-Rtg3p complex binds to E-box sites. For example, we have changed the R box to the E-box sequences, CAGCTG and CACGTG, while keeping the flanking DNA sequences the same. No significant binding was observed under conditions that yield strong binding to the wild-type R box (data not shown). The Rtg1p-Rtg3p heterodimeric complex bears some similarities to AHR and ARNT. AHR and ARNT are bHLH proteins that form a heterodimeric complex that regulates transcription of genes encoding some enzymes of xenobiotic metabolism (27­29, 41). The basic region of AHR does not conform well to the basic region of most bHLH proteins, whereas the basic region of ARNT does. Moreover, the target binding sites for the AHR-ARNT complex are xenobiotic responsive elements in the 5 flanking region of the responsive genes which are not consensus E boxes but rather have the consensus sequence 5 -T/GNGCGTGA/CG/CA-3 (18). Thus, the similarities to the Rtg1p-Rtg3p complex include one member of a bHLH heterodimeric pair that has a nonconforming basic region and target sites that are not the consensus E box. The regulation of the AHR-ARNT system includes a specific ligand binding to AHR, which results in transcriptional activation of the target genes due to the translocation of these transcription factors from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Our data also suggest the possibility that other proteins interact with or are recruited to the UASr complex by Rtg1p-Rtg3p. It will be interesting to learn whether any of the aforementioned properties can be extended to transcriptional activation by Rtg1p-Rtg3p. We do not know what signal(s) activates CIT2 transcription in cells with dysfunctional mitochondria. Although Rtg1p appears to be constitutively synthesized (32), it is possible that the relatively small change in expression of RTG3 in [rho0] cells triggers larger changes in CIT2 expression. Alternatively, the retrograde response might be controlled by posttranslational modifications of these proteins such as phosphorylation-de-
